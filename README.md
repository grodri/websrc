Source code for statistical computing logs and tutorials

This repository has the source code and supporting files for the
statistical software tutorials on the web:

- [Stata Tutorial](https://data.princeton.edu/stata)
- [Introducing R](https://data.princeton.edu/R)

The Stata Tutorial was written using `markstat`, a command for
combining Markdown annotations and Stata code, described
[here](https://grodri.github.io/markstat). Introducing R was
written using `rmarkdown`.

Coming Soon: Stata and R code for four applied statistics
courses on Generalized Linear Models, Multilevel Models,
Survival Analysis and Demographic Methods, all hosted on
the same website.
