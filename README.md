Source code for statistical computing logs and tutorials

This repository has the source code and supporting files for the
statistical software tutorials on the web:

- [Stata Tutorial](https://data.princeton.edu/stata)
- [Introducing R](https://data.princeton.edu/R)

The Stata Tutorial was written using `markstat`, a command for
combining Markdown annotations and Stata code, described
[here](https://grodri.github.io/markstat). Introducing R was
written using `rmarkdown`.

You will also find the source code for the computing logs for 
this course:

- [Survival Analysis](https://data.princeton.edu/pop509)

The logs show how to conduct statistical analyses using 
Stata or R, with tabs to choose your statistical software,
and were written using `markstat`.

Coming Soon: couses on Generalized Linear Models, 
Multilevel Models, and Demographic Methods.
