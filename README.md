Source code for statistical computing logs and tutorials

This repository has the source code and supporting files for the
statistical software tutorials on the web:

- [Stata Tutorial](https://grodri.github.io/stata)
- [Introducing R](https://grodri.github.io/R)

The Stata Tutorial was written using `markstat`, a command for
combining Markdown annotations and Stata code, described
[here](https://grodri.github.io/markstat). Introducing R was
written using `rmarkdown`.

You will also find the source code for the computing logs for 
these courses:

- [Multilevel Models](https://grodri.github.io/multilevel)
- [Survival Analysis](https://grodri.github.io/survival)
- [Demographic Methods](https://grodri.github.io/demography)

The 62 logs show how to conduct statistical analyses using 
Stata or R, with tabs to choose your statistical software,
and were written using `markstat`.

Work in Progress: updating the computing logs for the course on
Generalized Linear Models.
