Source code for statistical computing logs and tutorials

This repository has the source code and supporting files for the
statistical software tutorials on the web:

- [Stata Tutorial](https://grodri.github.io/stata)
- [Introducing R](https://grodri.github.io/R)

The Stata Tutorial was written using `markstat`, a command for
combining Markdown annotations and Stata code, described
[here](https://grodri.github.io/markstat). Introducing R was
written using [`rmarkdown`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).

You will also find the source code for the computing logs for 
these courses:

- [Multilevel Models](https://grodri.github.io/multilevel)
- [Survival Analysis](https://grodri.github.io/survival)
- [Demographic Methods](https://grodri.github.io/demography)

The 62 logs show how to conduct statistical analyses using 
Stata or R, with tabs to choose your statistical software,
and were written using `markstat`. To reproduce these you
need `markstat` and `bootstrap`, in addition to Stata and R,
as explained [here](https://grodri.github.io/markstat/stata-r-tabs)

I have now updated the Stata and R computing logs for the 
course on Generalized Linear Models.

- [GLMS Stata Logs](https://grodri.github.io/glms/stata)
- [GLMS R Logs](https://grodri.github.io/glms/r)

The 27 logs have separate Stata and R versions, so they can
be reproduced independently. The Stata  logs use `markstat`, 
and the scripts have extension `.stmd`. The R logs use
 `rmarkdown`, and the scripts have extension `.Rmd`.
