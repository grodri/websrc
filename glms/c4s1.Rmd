# 4. Poisson Models for Counts {#c4s1 .first}

This unit illustrates the use of Poisson regression for modeling count data.

## 4.3 A Poisson Model for Counts

We will use the data from Fiji on children ever born that appear on
Table 4.1 of the lecture notes. The data are available in the datasets
section in both plain text and Stata formats. We will read the Stata file:

```{r}
library(haven)
ceb <- read_dta("https://grodri.github.io/datasets/ceb.dta")
head(ceb)
```

The file has 70 observations, one for each cell in the table. Each
observation has a sequence number, numeric codes for marriage duration,
residence and education, the mean and variance of children ever born,
and the number of women in the cell.

### Mean-Variance Relationship

We start by doing Figure 4.1, plotting the cell variances versus the
cell means using a log-log-scale for cell with at least 20 cases.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
ceb20 <- filter(ceb, n > 20)
f <- function(x) x
png(file="c4fig1r.png", height=400, width=600)
ggplot(ceb20, aes(mean, var)) + geom_point() + 
  geom_function(fun=f) +  coord_trans(x="log", y="log") +  
  ggtitle("Figure 4.1. Mean-Variance Relationship", 
    subtitle="Children Ever Born in Fiji, 1976")
dev.off()
```

Clearly the variance increases with the mean. Most of the points lie
below the 45 degree line, indicating that the variance is not exactly
equal to the mean. Still, the assumption of proportionality brings us
much closer to the data than the assumption of constant variance.

### Response, Offset and Predictors

The dataset does not have information about the number of children ever
born (CEB) to each woman, but it turns out that we can still model the mean
by working with the cell totals and introducing the log of the number of
women in the cell as an *offset*.

If the number of CEB to *one* woman in a given cell is a
Poisson random variable with mean (and variance) $\mu$, then the number born
to all *n* women in that cell is a Poisson r.v. with mean (and variance)
$n\mu$. The log of the expected sum is $\log(n) + \log(\mu)$, and consists of
a known offset plus the quantity we are interested in modeling. See the
notes for further details

We therefore start by computing the outcome, the total CEB in each cell,
and the offset.
We also make sure the discrete variables read as "labeled" by `haven` 
are treated as factors.

```{r}
ceb <- mutate(ceb, y = round(mean * n), os = log(n),
  dur=as_factor(dur), res=as_factor(res), educ=as_factor(educ))
```

### The Null Model

We are ready to fit the null model, which has an offset but no
predictors.

```{r}
m0 <- glm(y ~ 1, family=poisson, offset=os, data=ceb)
m0
exp(coef(m0))
log(weighted.mean(ceb$mean, ceb$n))
```

The constant is the log of the mean number of children ever born.
Exponentiating we see that the estimated mean is almost four children
per woman. The estimate coincides with the sample mean, as we verified
by averaging the cell means with the number of women as a frequency weight.

The deviance of 3,732 on 69 d.f. gives a clear indication that the model
doesn't fit the data. The hypothesis that the expected number of CEB is
the same for all women regardless of marriage duration, residence and
education, is soundly rejected,

### One-Factor Models

Next we fit the three one-factor models, starting with residence:

```{r}
mr <- glm(y ~ res, family=poisson, offset=os, data=ceb)
mr	
exp(coef(mr))
anova(m0, mr)
```

The estimates show that women in urban and rural areas have on average
16 and 26% more children than women in Suva. The model chi-squared of 73
on 2 d.f. tells us that this model is a significant improvement over the
null. The deviance, still in the thousands, tells us that this model is
far from fitting the data.

Now for education

```{r}
me <- glm(y ~ educ, family=poisson, offset=os, data=ceb)
me	
exp(coef(me))
anova(m0, me)
```

The estimates show that the number of CEB declines substantially with
education. Women with secondary education or more have 71% fewer
children than women with no education (or only 29% as many). The
educational differential is highly significant, but this model doesn't
fit the data.

Finally, here's duration:

```{r}
md <- glm(y ~ dur, family=poisson, offset=os, data=ceb)
md	
exp(coef(md))
anova(m0, md)
```

Not surprisingly, the number of CEB is much higher for women who have
been married longer. This is by far the most important predictor of CEB,
with a chi-squared of 3,566 on just 5 d.f. In fact, a demographer
wouldn't even have looked at models that did not include a control for
duration of marriage. It's nice to see that Poisson regression can
uncover the obvious :) Note that this model still doesn't fit the data.

The deviances given in this section are pretty close to the deviances in
Table 4.3 of the notes. You will notice small differences due to the use
of different rounding procedures. In the notes we multiplied the mean
CEB by the number of women and retained a few decimals. Here we rounded
the total number of CEB to the nearest integer. If you omit the rounding
you will reproduce the results in the notes exactly.

### Two-Factor Models

We now consider models that take two of the three factors into account.
Following the notes we consider only models that include duration of
marriage, an essential control when we study cumulative fertility. This
leaves two models with main effects of two factors, and another two
models that add one interaction.

Because we are only interested in deviances I will run the estimation
commands quietly.

So here are the additive models

```{r}
mdr <- glm(y ~ dur + res, family=poisson, offset=os, data=ceb)
deviance(mdr)
mde <- glm(y ~ dur + educ, family=poisson, offset=os, data=ceb)
deviance(mde)
```

And here are the models with one interaction

```{r}
mdxr <- glm(y ~ dur * res, family=poisson, offset=os, data=ceb)
deviance(mdxr)
mdxe <- glm(y ~ dur * educ, family=poisson, offset=os, data=ceb)
deviance(mdxe)	
```

The best fit so far is the model that includes duration and education,
but it exhibits significant lack of fit with a chi-squared of 84.5 on 46
d.f.

### The Three-Factor Additive Model

We are now ready to look at models that include all three factors. We
start with the additive model.

```{r}
mder <- glm(y ~ dur + res + educ, family=poisson, offset=os, data=ceb)
summary(mder)
exp(coef(mder))
```

This model passes the goodness of fit hurdle, with a deviance of 70.67
on 59 d.f. and a corresponding P-value of 0.14, so we have no evidence
against this model.

Briefly, the estimates indicate that the number of CEB increases rapidly
with marital duration; in each category of residence and education women
married 15-19 years have five times as many children as those married
less than five years. Women who live in urban and rural areas have 12%
and 16% more children than women who live in Suva and have the same
marriage duration and education. Finally, more educated women have fewer
children, as women with secondary or more education have on average 27%
fewer children than women with no education who live in the same type of
place of residence and have been married just as long.

### Three-Factor Models with Interactions

We now put the additive model to some "stress tests" by considering
all possible interactions.

```{r}
models <- c("dur+res*educ","dur*res+educ","dur*educ+res",
  "(dur+res)*educ","(dur+educ)*res","dur*(res+educ)",
  "dur*res*educ - dur:res:educ")
dd <- matrix(0,length(models),2)
i <- 1
for(model in models) {
  formula <- paste("y ~",model)
  m <- glm(formula, family=poisson, offset=os, data=ceb)
  dd[i,] <- c(deviance(m), m$df.residual)
  i <- i+1
}
data.frame(model=models, deviance=round(dd[,1],2), df=dd[,2],
  pval=round(pchisq(dd[,1],dd[,2],lower.tail=FALSE),4))
```

These calculations complete Table 4.3 in the notes. I reported the
deviances for consistency with the notes, but could just as well have
reported likelihood ratio tests comparing each of these models to the
additive model. Make sure you know how to use the output to test, for
example, whether we need to add a duration by education interaction. It
should be clear from the list of deviances that we don't need to add
any of these terms. We conclude that the additive model does a fine job
indeed.

It's important to note that the need for interactions depends exactly
on what's being modeled. Here we used the log link, so all effects are
*relative*. In this scale no interactions are needed. If we used the
identity link we would be modeling the actual number of children ever
born, and all effects would be *absolute*. In that scale we would need,
at the very least, interactions with duration of marriage. See the notes
for further discussion.
