## 8.2 Longitudinal Linear Model

Here's an interesting example where fixed-effects gives a very
different answer from OLS and random-effects models. The data come from
Wooldridge's text and concern state-level data on the percentage of
births classified as low birth weight and the percentage of the
population in the AFDC welfare program in 1987 and 1990. The data are
available from the Stata website.

```{r}
library(haven)
lbw <- read_dta("https://www.stata.com/data/jwooldridge/eacsap/lowbirth.dta")
```

### OLS

Here's a regression of low birth weight on AFDC with a dummy for 1990
(time trends) and controls for log physicians per capita, log beds per
capita, log per capita income, and log population.

```{r}
ols <- lm(lowbrth ~ d90 + afdcprc + lphypc + lbedspc + lpcinc + lpopul, data = lbw)
summary(ols)
```

It seems as if AFDC has a pernicious effect on low birth weight: each
percent in AFDC is associated with an extra 1/10-th of one percent with
low birth weight. A scatterplot shows a positive correlation:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
png("afdc1r.png", width=500, height=400)
ggplot(lbw, aes(afdcprc, lowbrth, color=as.factor(year))) + geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Low Birth Weight and AFDC Participation") +
  labs(x="Percent low birth weight", y="Percent in AFDC")
dev.off()
```

### Random-Effects

Fitting a random-effects model improves things a bit.

```{r}
library(lme4)
lbw$stateabb <- as.factor(lbw$stateabb)
re <- lmer(lowbrth ~ d90 + afdcprc + lphypc + lbedspc + lpcinc + lpopul + 
  (1 | stateabb), REML = FALSE, data=lbw)
summary(re, corr = FALSE)
s2u <- as.numeric(VarCorr(re))
s2e <- sigma(re)^2
s2u/(s2u + s2e) # icc
```

The effect of AFDC is now negative, as we would expect, but not
significant. The intra-state correlation over the two years is a
remarkable 0.96; persistent state characteristics account for most of
the variation in the percent with low birth weight after controlling for
AFDC participation and all other variables.

### Fixed-Effects

Fitting a fixed-effects model gives much more reasonable results:

```{r}
library(plm)
fe <- plm(lowbrth ~ d90 + afdcprc + lphypc + lbedspc + lpcinc + lpopul, 
  data=lbw, index = "stateabb", method = "within")
summary(fe)
```

Now every percent increase in AFDC is associated with a *decline* of
almost 2/10-th of a percentage point in low birth weight. The
coefficient of log physicians per capita is highly suspect; this is due
to high correlation with the other predictors, most notably the log of
population. In fact once we have state fixed effects we don't really
need the other controls:

```{r}
fe2 <- plm(lowbrth ~ d90 + afdcprc, 
  data=lbw, index = "stateabb", method = "within")
summary(fe2)
```

One way to see what's going on is to compute and plot differences in the
percent with low birth weight and the percent with AFDC. We
could reshape to wide, but I will keep the data in long format:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
y90 <- filter(lbw, year == 1990)
y87 <- filter(lbw, year == 1987)
lbwd <- data.frame( lowbrthd = y90$lowbrth - y87$lowbrth,
  afdcd = y90$afdcprc - y87$afdcprc)
png("afdc2r.png", width = 500, height = 400)
ggplot(lbwd, aes(afdcd, lowbrthd)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method="lm") +
  ggtitle("Changes in Low Birth Weight and in AFDC Participation") +
  labs(x="Change in AFDC", y="Change in low birth weight")
dev.off()
```

### FE and Differencing

Let us verify that we get the same results using regression on the
differences. The constant is the coefficient of `d90` and the slope is
the coefficient of `afdcprc`:

```{r}
fe_diff <- lm(lowbrthd ~ afdcd, data = lbwd)
summary(fe_diff)
```

### FE and Dummy Variables

Finally we verify that we get the same results using state dummies.

```{r}
fe_dummy <- lm(lowbrth ~ d90 + afdcprc + stateabb, data=lbw)
summary(fe_dummy)$coefficients[1:3,]
```

I just omitted from the listing the state dummies
