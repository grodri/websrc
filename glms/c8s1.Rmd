# 8. Models for Clustered and Panel Data {#c8s1 .first}

We will illustrate the analysis of clustered or panel data using three
examples, two dealing with linear models and one with logits models.
The linear model examples use clustered school data on IQ and language
ability, and longitudinal state-level data on Aid to Families with
Dependent Children (AFDC).

## 8.1 Clustered Linear Model

Snijders and Boskers (1999), *Multilevel Analysis*, have data for 2287
8-th grade children in 131 schools in The Netherlands.
The data are available in the datasets section in a Stata file and can
be read directly from Stata or R.

```{r}
library(haven)
sn <- read_dta("https://grodri.github.io/datasets/snijders.dta")
```

### OLS

We are interested in the relationship between verbal IQ and the score in
a language test. OLS gives a highly significant coefficient of 2.65 with
a standard error of 0.072:

```{r}
ols <- lm(langpost ~ iq_verb, data=sn)
coef(summary(ols))
```

### Random Effects

We consider the fact that the observations are probably correlated
within each school, because of unobserved school characteristics that
affect language scores (such as a good language teacher).

```{r}
library(lme4)
re <- lmer(langpost ~ iq_verb + (1 | schoolnr), data=sn, REML = FALSE)
summary(re)
v = as.numeric(VarCorr(re)) # variance of random effects
v/(v + sigma(re)^2)         # intra-class correlation
-2*(logLik(ols)-logLik(re)) # LR test
```

The coefficient of verbal IQ is 2.49 with a standard error of 0.071 and
is still highly significant. We have also learned that the language
scores *are* correlated within schools; in fact, 18.3% of the variation
in language scores net of verbal IQ can be attributed to the schools
(the rest is due to the pupils). The intra-class correlation is highly
significant, as shown by a test statistic of 225.9 (conservatively a
chi-squared with one d.f.)

### Fixed-Effects (Within)

We now consider a fixed-effects model that allows for the possibility of
a correlation between unobserved school characteristics and verbal IQ
(the school with the good teacher attracts brighter students):

To estimate a fixed-effects model in R we use the `plm` package.

```{r}
library(plm)
fe <- plm(langpost ~ iq_verb, data = sn, model = "within", index = "schoolnr")
summary(fe)
```

Our results are very robust, the coefficient of verbal IQ is 2.41 with a
standard error of 0.071. We feel pretty confident in our conclusions.
Note that we get an F-test for school effects, which are highly
significant.

### Group Means (Between)

If you are not deterred by the ecological fallacy you could have analyzed group means.
We group the data by school and then calculate the mean outcome and predictor, as well 
as the number of students in the school, which we use as weight in the regression.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
msn <- summarize(group_by(sn, schoolnr), 
  langpost=mean(langpost), iq_verb=mean(iq_verb), w=n())
be <- lm(langpost ~ iq_verb, data=msn, weight = w)
summary(be)
```

This gives a much larger coefficient of 3.90, albeit with a larger
standard error of 0.334. Clearly working with aggregate data would
overestimate the relationship between verbal IQ and language scores.
Note that the random-effects estimate is between the within and between
estimates (it always is).

### Comparison of Estimates

The following figure shows the data, separate regression fits for each of
the 131 schools, and the between, within, and random-effects estimates.
First we run the school regressions

```{r}
fits <- group_by(sn, schoolnr) |> do(lf = lm(langpost ~ iq_verb, data = .))
sr <- data.frame(id = fits[[1]], t(sapply(fits[[2]], coef)))
names(sr) <- c("schoolnr", "sa", "sb")
snp <- left_join(sn, sr, by= "schoolnr") |> mutate(fv = sa + sb * iq_verb)
```
And then we do the combined plot

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
fei <- mean(sn$langpost - coef(fe)*sn$iq_verb) # intercept for within estimate
png("snijdersr.png", width=500, height=400)
ggplot(snp, aes(iq_verb, langpost)) + geom_point(color="#c0c0c0") +
  geom_line( aes(iq_verb, fv, group=schoolnr), color="#c0c0c0") +
  geom_abline(intercept=fixef(re)[1], slope=fixef(re)[2], color="green", size=1) +
  geom_abline(intercept=coef(be)[1], slope=coef(be)[2], color="red", size=1) +
  geom_abline(intercept=fei, slope=coef(fe), color="blue", size=1) +
  ggtitle("Language Scores and Verbal IQ") + labs(x="Verbal IQ", y="Language Score")
dev.off()
```

![](snijdersr.png){.img-responsive .center-block .r}

The red line is the between-groups estimate, which overstates the
relationship between IQ and language scores. The blue line is the
within-groups or fixed-effects estimator. The green line is the
random-effects estimator, which is always an average of the within and
between, and in this case comes very close to the within-group
estimator.
