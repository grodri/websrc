## 6.2 The Multinomial Logit Model {#c6s2 .first}

Make sure you read the data as shown in [Section 6.1](c6s1).

```{r}
library(haven)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
cuselong <- read_dta("elsalvador1985.dta") |> 
  mutate(ageg=as_factor(ageg))
cuse <- pivot_wider(cuselong, names_from=cuse, values_from=cases)
names(cuse)[2:4] <- c("ster", "other", "none")
```
We start with multinomial logit models treating age as a predictor and
contraceptive use as the outcome.
R has several functions that can fit multinomial logit models. We will 
emphasize the classic `multinom` in Venables and Ripley's `nnet` package 
because it is simple, does everything we need, and is already included in 
your R installation. Alternatives include `mlogit` and `mnlogit`; these
fit a wider variety of models, but are a bit harder to use.

### Age as a Factor

Obviously the model that treats age as a factor with 7 levels is
saturated for this data. We can easily obtain the log-likelihood, and
predicted values if we needed them.
[By default `multinom` picks the first response category as the reference. 
We take care of that by putting "no method" first.`]{.r}'

```{r}
library(nnet)
cuse$Y <- as.matrix(cuse[,c("none","ster","other")])
msat <- multinom(Y ~ ageg, data=cuse)
msat
```

You could use `summary(msat)` to obtain standard errors as well, but we'll
skip those.

### Linear and Quadratic Effects

Following the notes, we will consider a model with linear and quadratic
effects of age. To this end we define the midpoints of age and its
square. For consistency with the notes we will not center age before
computing the square, although I generally recommend that.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
cuse <- mutate(cuse, age = seq(17.5,47.5,5)[ageg], agesq = age^2)
cuse$Y = as.matrix(cuse[, c("none", "ster", "other")])
mlq <- multinom(Y ~ age + agesq, data=cuse)
summary(mlq)
B <- coef(mlq)
-0.5 * B[,"age"]/B[,"agesq"]		
```

Compare the parameter estimates with Table 6.2 in the notes. As usual
with quadratics, it is easier to plot the results, which we do below. The
log-odds of using sterilization rather than no method increase rapidly
with age to reach a maximum at 36.5. The log-odds of using a method
other than sterilization rather than no method, increase slightly to
reach a maximum at age 27.8 and then decline. (The turning points were
calculated by setting the derivatives to zero.)

```{r}
anova(multinom(Y~1, data=cuse), mlq)
```

The model chi-squared, which as usual compares the current and null
models, indicates that the hypothesis of no age differences in
contraceptive choise is soundly rejected with a chi-squared of 500.6 on
4 d.f. To see where the d.f. come from, note that the current model has
six parameters (two quadratics with three parameters each) and the null
model of course has only two (the two constants).

To test the goodness of fit of the model we compare it with the model
that treats age as a factor, which is saturated for these data.
The "deviances" reported by `multinom`' for these models are 5766.273 and 
5745.798. They are calculated as *-2logL*, where *logL* is the individual 
data log-likelihood. This is why the "deviance" for the saturated model is 
not zero. But we can compute differences among deviances, which are correct.

```{r}
anova(mlq, msat) 
# or "by hand"
x2 <- deviance(mlq) - deviance(msat)
data.frame(chisq=x2, pvalue=pchisq(x2, 8, lower.tail=FALSE))
```

The deviance of 20.47 on 8 d.f. is significant at the 1% level, so we
have evidence that this model does not fit the data. We explore the lack
of fit using a graph.

### Plotting Observed and Fitted Logits

Let us do Figure 6.1, comparing observed and fitted logits.

We plot observed versus fitted logits, using markers for the
observed values and smooth curves for the quadratics.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
cuse <- mutate(cuse, obs.s = log(ster/none), obs.o = log(other/none))
fit1 <- function(x) B[1,1] + B[1,2]*x + B[1,3]*x^2
fit2 <- function(x) B[2,1] + B[2,2]*x + B[2,3]*x^2
png("fig61r.png", width=500, height=400)
ggplot(cuse, aes(age, obs.s)) + geom_point() + geom_point(aes(age, obs.o)) +
      geom_function(fun=fit1, color="green") + geom_function(fun=fit2, color="red") +
      ggtitle("Contraceptive Use by Age") + ylab("log-odds (no method as baseline)") +
  annotate(geom="text", x=48, y=fit1(48)-.2, label="ster", color="green") +
  annotate(geom="text", x=48, y=fit2(48)-.2, label="other", color="red") 
    dev.off()
```

![](fig61r.png){.img-responsive .center-block .r}

The graph suggests that most of the lack of fit comes from
overestimation of the relative odds of being sterilized compared to
using no method at ages 15-19. Adding a dummy for this age group
confirms the result:

```{r}
cuse <- mutate(cuse, age1519 = ageg=="15-19")
md <- multinom(Y ~ age + agesq + age1519, data=cuse)
anova(md, msat)
```

The deviance is now only 12.10 on 6 d.f., so we pass the goodness of fit
test. (We really didn't need the dummy in the equation for other
methods, so the gain comes from just one d.f.)

An important caveat with multinomial logit models is that we are
modeling odds or *relative* probabilities, and it is always possible for
the odds of one category to increase while the probability of that
category declines, simply because the odds of another category increase
more. To examine this possibility one can always compute predicted
probabilities.

We pursue these issues at greater length in a discussion of the interpretation
of multinomial logit coefficients, including the calculation of continuous and
discrete marginal effects, in [an analysis available here](mlogit).
