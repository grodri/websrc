# 2. Linear Models {#c2s1 .first}

We start with the linear models in Chapter 2 of the lecture notes,
showing how to use the
`lm()` function in R
to fit regression, analysis of variance, and analysis of covariance models.

## 2.1 The Program Effort Data

For a brief description of the program effort data see the lecture notes
or point your browser to the datasets page.
All datasets used in the course are in plain text format, and they are also
available as Stata system files. Both formats can be read directly from the web.

```{r}
fpe <- read.table("https://grodri.github.io/datasets/effort.dat")
```

The `read.table()` function produces a data frame, which we assign to `fpe`. 
To make sure everything is alright we list the data by simply typing `fpe`,
which invokes the `print()` method.

```{r}
fpe
```

As you can see, we have 20 observations on three variables:  social `setting`,
family planning `effort`, and fertility `change`.
The country names serve as row names. Tidy tools prefer a separate column,
which you can create by typing `fpe$country = row.names(fpe)`.

The next thing we want to do is plot the data for a closer look. The importance
of becoming familiar with your data before undertaking sophisticated analyses
cannot be over-emphasized. Let us create scatterplots of all pairs of variables,
reproducing Figure 2.1 in the notes.

The `pairs()` function in base R creates scatterplots of all pairs of variables.
Obviously only numeric variables should be included, but that's not a problem 
here, and we could just say `pairs(fpe)`. I think, however, that the plot is 
easier to read if we use the same order as in the notes, which we can easily 
do using the variable names as column subscripts. (Fans of `ggplot` might want
to use `ggpairs` in the `GGally` package instead.)

```{r}
png(filename = "pairsr.png", width=500, height=400)
pairs(fpe[, c("change","setting","effort")], 
	main="Figure 2.1. Scatterplot Matrix")
dev.off()
```

R graphs are displayed in the active graphics device. Here we opened a PNG
device and drew the graph. If you are using R interactively via R Studio, you
can also use `export` in the graphical user interface (GUI) to save the graph
as PDF, or in a variety of image formats.
