## 2.4 Simple Linear Regression {#c2s4 .first}

We will start with the simplest possible model, the *null* model, which
fits just a constant. But first we read the data again, so this script
can be run independently of the previous one.

```{r}
fpe <- read.table("https://grodri.github.io/datasets/effort.dat")	
m0 <- lm(change ~ 1, data=fpe)
m0
```

The average fertility decline in these countries between 1965 and 1975 was 14.3%.

The first argument to `lm()` is a *model formula*, which defines the response,
followed by a tilde and a list of terms. In this case the only term is `1`,
representing the constant. The `data` argument specifies the data frame to be
used. The function returns a linear model ("lm") object that we called `m0`.
Typing this name invokes the `print()` method, which simply lists the formula 
and the estimated coefficients. For more information we use the `summary()` method:

```{r}
summary(m0)
```

We now get standard errors and a t-test of significance. If you want a confidence
interval just call the function `confint()`.

If you are wondering what these statistics mean when the 20 countries at hand
are not really a random sample of the countries of the world, see the discussion
of model-based inference in the notes. Briefly, we view the data as a sample
from the universe of all the outcomes we could have observed in these countries
in the period 1965-1970.

### Fitting a Linear Term

The next step is to try a linear regression of change on setting. We do not
need to specify a constant because it is always included, unless we use
`-1` to exclude it. Last time we were explicit because the constant was the 
only term.

```{r}
m1 <- lm(change ~ setting, data=fpe)
m1
```

Each point in the social setting scale is associated with a fertility decline
of half a percent. Compare the parameter estimates with those in table 2.3
in the lecture notes.

To obtain more detailed results  we use again the `summary()` function.

```{r}
summary(m1)
```

We can also obtain the analysis of variance in Table 2.4 using `anova()`

```{r}
anova(m1)
```

The total sum of squares of 2650.2 has been decomposed into 1201.1 that can be
attributed to social setting and 1449.1 that remains unexplained.

### Computing R-Squared.

Let us calculate the R-squared "by hand" as the ratio of the model sum
of squares to the total sum of squares.

There are a number of functions that can be used to access elements of a linear
model, for example `coef()` returns the coefficients, `fitted()` returns the
fitted values, and `resid()` returns the residuals, or differences between observed
and fitted values. We will add our own function to compute the residual sum of
squares.

```{r}
rss <- function(lmfit) {
	sum(resid(lmfit)^2)
}
1 - rss(m1)/rss(m0)
```

Almost half the variation in fertility decline can be expressed as a
linear effect of social setting.

### Plotting Observed and Fitted Values.

Let us try to reproduce Figure 2.3. We want to plot fertility change
versus setting, labeling the points with the country names and
superimposing the regression line.

To draw a graph we first open a graphics device, in this case `png` to produce 
portable network graphics. 
We could draw this graph using `plot()` for the points, `text()` for the labels
and `abline()` for the regression line, all in base R, but we will use `ggplot`
instead. When we add country names we get some overprinting. A simple solution
is to use a horizontal adjustment `left`, so the labels come after the points, 
except for Costa Rica (#5) and Trinidad-Tobago (#19), where we use `right`, so the 
labels come before the points. We also use a vertical adjustment of `center` for
all, `top` for Costa Rica, and `bottom` for Trinidad-Tobago to space these two.
We also nudge the labels a bit, so there is some space between them and the points.
Finally we extend the x-axis to leave more room for the labels.

```{r}
png(filename = "fig23r.png", width=500, height=400)
library(ggplot2)
# move TrinidadTObago and CostaRica to right and vertically above and below
hj <- rep("left",nrow(fpe));    hj[c(5,19)] <- "right"
vj <- rep("center", nrow(fpe)); vj[5]="bottom"; vj[19]="top"
nx <- rep(0.6, nrow(fpe));      nx[c(5,19)] <- -0.6
ggplot(fpe, aes(setting, change, label=rownames(fpe))) + 
  geom_point() + geom_text(hjust=hj,vjust=vj, nudge_x=nx, size=3) + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm") + coord_cartesian(xlim=c(35, 100)) +
  ggtitle("Figure 2.3: Fertility Change by Social Setting")
dev.off()
```

*Note:* The `plot()` method for linear model fits produces four plots: residuals 
versus fitted values, a Q-Q plot for normality, a scale-location plot, and a plot
of residuals versus leverages.  We will learn about these statistics in [Section
2.9](c2s9). If you are curious try typing `par(mfrow=c(2,2))` and `plot(m1)`.
The first call changes the graphics device layout to show four plots in two rows 
and two columns. When you are done type `par(mfrow=c(1,1)` to restore the default.

*Exercise*: Run the simple linear regression model for fertility change
as a function of program effort and plot the results.
