## 2.8 Analysis of Covariance Models {#c2s8 .first}

We now consider models that include as predictors a continuous variable
and a discrete factor, sometimes called *ancova* models.
As usual, we read the data and group effort into categories, so we can
run this unit by itself.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
fpe <- read.table("https://grodri.github.io/datasets/effort.dat")	
fpe <- mutate(fpe, effort_g = cut(effort, breaks=c(min(effort), 5, 15, max(effort)),
  right=FALSE, include.lowest=TRUE, labels=c("Weak","Moderate","Strong")))
```

Here's the model treating social setting as a covariate with a linear
effect and program effort as a factor variable with three categories

```{r}
m2cg <- lm(change ~ setting + effort_g, data=fpe)
summary(m2cg)
```

Compare the coefficients with Table 2.23 in the notes. Countries with
strong programs show steeper fertility declines, on average 19 percentage
points more, than countries with weak programs and the same social
setting.

To test the significance of the net effect of effort we use
the `anova()` function.

```{r}
anova(m2cg)
```

We obtain an F-ratio of  14.1 on 2 and 16 d.f., a significant result.
[The complete anova in Table 2.24 in the notes can be obtained from 
the model with a linear effect of setting in [Section 2.4](c2s4) and
the present model.]{stata}

This analysis has adjusted for linear effects of setting, whereas the
analysis in [Section 2.7](c2s7) adjusted for differences by setting
grouped in three categories. As it happens, both analyses lead to
similar estimates of the difference between strong and weak programs at
the same level of setting.

### Plotting Observed and Fitted

Let us do Figure 2.5, a plot of change versus setting identifying the
level of program effort corresponding to each point. I will also
superimpose the three parallel lines corresponding to the fitted model.

We call `fitted()` to calculate fitted values, use the levels of `effort_g` 
to label the points, left-justified with a bit of space, and then plot the 
fitted regression lines for each level of effort.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
fpe <- mutate(fpe, fitted=fitted(m2cg))
png(file="fig25r.png", width=500, height=400)	
ggplot(fpe, aes(setting, change, label=effort_g)) + geom_point() + 
  geom_text(hjust="left", nudge_x=0.6, size=3) +
  geom_line(data=group_by(fpe, effort_g), aes(setting, fitted, color=effort_g)) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(35, 95))
dev.off()
```

### Adjusted and Unadjusted Means

Let us turn to the comparison of adjusted and unadjusted declines in
Table 2.26, a useful way to present regression results to a
non-technical audience.

```{r}
b <- coef(m2cg)	
fpe <- mutate(fpe, adj_change = 
  b[1] + b[2]*72.1 + b[3]*(effort_g=="Moderate") + b[4]*(effort_g=="Strong") )
```
Next we tabulate our data by level of effort and summarize observed and
adjusted change.

```{r}
group_by(fpe, effort_g) |> 
  summarize(observed=mean(change), adjusted=mean(adj_change))
```

Countries with strong program average a 28% decline in fertility, but
they also tend to have higher settings; we estimate a slightly smaller
decline of about 26% at average social setting. The estimate is based on
the model, which adjusts linearly for setting and assumes that the slope
is the same at all levels of effort. The next step will be to examine
this assumption.

### The Assumption of Parallelism

We will now allow the linear relationship between change and setting to
vary with level of effort, by introducing an interaction between setting
and the indicators of effort. Before we do that we center the index of
social setting by subtracting the mean, a practice I highly recommend to
simplify the interpretation of "main" effects when the model has
interactions:

```{r}
fpe <- mutate(fpe, setting_c = setting - mean(setting))
```

We can now run the regression using

```{r}
m3cg <- lm(change ~ setting_c * effort_g, data = fpe)
summary(m3cg)
anova(m3cg)
```

Compare the parameter estimates with Table 2.27 in the notes. You also
have all the information required to produce the hierarchical anova in
Table 2.28.

Because we centered setting, the coefficients for moderate and strong
programs summarize differences by effort at mean setting, rather than at
setting zero (which is well outside the range of the data). Thus,
fertility decline averages 13 percentage points more under strong than
under weak programs in countries with average social setting.

The interaction terms can be used to compute how these differences vary
as we move away from the mean. For example in countries which are ten
points above the mean social setting, the strong versus weak difference
is almost five percentage points more than at the mean. These
differences, however, are not significant, as we can't reject the
hypothesis that the three slopes are equal.

*Exercise*. Plot the data and the regression lines implied by the model
with an interaction between linear setting and level of effort. Note how
the difference between strong and weak programs increases with social setting.
The interaction is not significant, however, so we have no evidence that the
lines are not in fact parallel.
