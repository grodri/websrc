## 6.3 The Conditional Logit Model {#c6s3 .first}

Stata and R are also able to fit the more general McFadden conditional logit
model discussed in the notes, a random-utility model where the expected
utility of a choice may depend on characteristics of the alternatives,
characteristics of the people making the choices, and variables which
are specific to a combination of person and alternative, for example
distance to a cinema. The special case where all predictors are
individual characteristics is the multinomial logit model of the
previous section.

If you are interested in this type of model I recommend that you download 
the packages `mlogit` and/or `mnlogit` and study their documentation. 
The more general model is beyond the scope of the course.
