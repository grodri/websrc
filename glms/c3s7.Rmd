## 3.7 Other Choices of Link

Two brief notes on the latent variable formulation of binary response
models and the use of alternative links. First we plot three different
links in a standardized scale. Second we compare logit and probit
estimates for a model of contraceptive use.

### Three Link Functions

Let us reproduce Figure 3.7, which shows the logit, probit and
complementary log-log link, after standardizing the latent variable so
it has mean 0 and variance 1. The probit link is based on the standard
normal distribution, which is already standardized. The logit link is
based on the standard logistic distribution, which has mean 0 and
variance π^2^/3. The c-log-log link is based on the extreme value (log
Weibull) distribution, with mean 0.577 and variance π^2^/6.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
z = seq(-2, 2, .05)
links <- data.frame(z, probit = pnorm(z), logit = plogis(z*pi/sqrt(3)), 
  cloglog = 1-exp(-exp(-0.577 + z * pi/sqrt(6))))
links.longer <- pivot_longer(links, cols=c("probit", "logit","cloglog"), 
  names_to="link")
png(filename="fig37r.png", width=500, height=400)	
ggplot(links.longer, aes(z, value, linetype=link)) + geom_line() +
  scale_linetype_manual(
	values=c("probit"="solid", "logit"="dashed", "cloglog"="longdash")) +
  ggtitle("Figure 3.7. Probit, Logit and C-log-Log Links", 
    subtitle="Standardized") + ylab("Probability") + xlab("Linear Predictor")
dev.off()
```

As you can see, the logit and probit links are virtually
indistinguisable. The c-log-log link looks different, but one would
still need very large sample sizes to be able to distinguish it from the
others.

### A Probit Model

We will fit a probit model to the data on contraceptive use by age and
desire for more children. Following the notes we will pick the
specification where age is treated linearly and we include an
interaction between age and desire for no more children. To simplify
interpretation of the interaction we center age at 30 years.

```{r}
library(haven)
library(dplyr)
cuse <- read_dta("d:/dataweb/wws509/datasets/cusew.dta") 
cuse <- mutate(cuse, agemc = c(-10,-2.5,5,15)[age], Y = cbind(users, nonusers))
probit <- glm(Y ~ agemc*nomore, family=binomial(link="probit"), data=cuse)
probit
```

Probit coefficients can be interpreted in terms of a standardized latent
variable representing a propensity to use contraception, or the
difference in expected utilities between using and not using
contraception.

We see that the propensity among women who want more children increases
with age at the rate of just over one tenth of a standard deviation per
year. More interestingly, the propensity is 0.44 standard deviations
higher among women who want no more children than among those who want
more at age 30. This difference increases by 0.03 standard deviations
per year of age, so it is 0.13 standard deviations at age 20 but 0.74
standard deviations at age 40. As a result, the propensity to use
contraception among women who want no more children is 0.04 standard
deviations higher per year of age.

It may be of interest to compare logit and probit coefficients. One way
to compare them is to divide the logit coefficients by π/√3 = 1.8.
This standardizes the logistic latent variable to have variance one, so
the coefficients have the same interpretation as a probit model. The first
two columns in the table below show that the two sets of coefficients are
in fact very similar

```{r}
logit <- glm(Y ~ agemc*nomore, family=binomial, data=cuse)
data.frame(probit=coef(probit), std.logit=coef(logit)/(pi/sqrt(3)), 
  amemiya=coef(logit)/1.6)
```

Gelman and Hill (2007), following Amemiya (1981), recommend dividing by 1.6.
This factor was chosen by trial and error to make the transformed logistic
approximate the standard normal distribution over a wide domain. As
shown in the third column above, it gives a somewhat closer approximation
to the probit coefficients in our example, particularly for the interaction
term. Of course the difference between dividing by 1.8 or 1.6 is not going to
be large.
