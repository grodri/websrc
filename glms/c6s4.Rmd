## 6.4 The Sequential Logit Model {#c6s4 .first}

We now fit the *hierarchical* logit model described in the notes.
Because the term hierarchical has come to be closely associated with
multilevel models, I now prefer calling this model the *sequential*
logit model, reflecting the fact that the model proceeds as if decisions
were made in a sequence of stages.

This model is not to be confused with the *nested* logit model, a term
used in econometrics to refer to a random-utility model where the errors
within subsets of choices are correlated and the predictors include
alternative-specific variables.  Our approach is much simpler, but doesn't
have a strict utility maximization interpretation.

We assume that women first decide whether to use a method or not, and
model this choice using a conventional logit model. We then focus
exclusively on women who use a method, and model their choice of
sterilization or another method using another conventional logit model.
(I told you this would be simpler :)

### The Decision to Use

We continue to use the same dataset as in the previous sections.
[All we need to get started is a variable to identify users of contraception.]{ .stata} 

```{r}
library(haven)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
cuse <- read_dta("elsalvador1985.dta") |> 
  mutate(ageg=as_factor(ageg), age=12.5 + 5*as.numeric(ageg), agesq=age^2) |>
  pivot_wider(names_from=cuse, values_from=cases) 
names(cuse)[4:6] <- c("ster", "other", "none")
```

We then model the logit of the probability of using contraception as a
quadratic function of age:

```{r}
use <- glm(cbind(ster+other, none) ~ age + agesq, family=binomial, data=cuse)
summary(use)
b <- coef(use)
-0.5*b["age"]/b["agesq"]
```

The estimates indicate that the odds of using contraception
(sterilization or other method as opposed to no method) increase with
age to reach a maximum at 34.7 and then decline. This is more easily
appreciated in a graph, which we will do below.

### The Choice of Method Among users

For the second step we look just at current users, and model the logit
of the conditional probability of being sterilized given that the woman
uses contraception as a quadratic function of age:

```{r}
ster <- glm(cbind(ster, other) ~ age + agesq, family=binomial, data=cuse)
summary(ster)
b <- coef(ster)
-0.5*b["age"]/b["agesq"]
```

The estimates indicate that the odds of begin sterilized among users
(sterilization as opposed to other method) increase with age, but at a
decreasing rate, reaching a maximum at 43.6. Again, a picture is worth a
tousand words and we will plot these curves below.

### Comparing Model Likelihoods and Deviances

To obtain the log-likehood for the sequential model we simply add the
log-likelihoods for each stage. We can then compare this to the log-likelihood
for a saturated multinomial model to get a sequential logit deviance.
We can use `multinom()` for the saturated multinomial, but we can also run
two sequential logits with age as a factor using `glm()`. Because these
functions use individual and grouped data log-likelihoods, as noted earlier,
we will stick with `glm()` for simplicity.

```{r}
use_sat <- glm(cbind(ster + other, none) ~ ageg, family=binomial, data=cuse)
ster_sat <- glm(cbind(ster, other) ~ ageg, family=binomial, data=cuse)
dev = -2*(logLik(use) + logLik(ster) - logLik(use_sat) - logLik(ster_sat))
data.frame(deviance=dev, df=8, pvalue=pchisq(dev, 8, lower.tail=FALSE))
```

The deviance of 16.89 on 8 d.f. is a bit better (lower) than the comparable
multinomial logit model of [Section 6.2](c2s6) with linear and quadratic
effects of age, which was ??? although the difference is small and we have some
evidence that the model does not fit the data.  We will build a plot to
examine where the lack of fit comes from.

### Plotting Observed and Fitted Logits

We now produce a figure similar to 6.1, but for the sequential logit model.
We could produce *observed* logits from logit models treating age as a factor
with seven levels, but we can easily compute these "by hand".

```{r}
cuse <- mutate(cuse, obs_u=log((ster+other)/none), obs_s=log(ster/other))
  
```

We can then plot observed versus fitted logits for each equation:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
fit_u <- function(x) cbind(rep(1,length(x)),x,x^2) %*% coef(use)
fit_s <- function(x) cbind(rep(1,length(x)),x,x^2) %*% coef(ster)
png("fig62r.png", width=500, height=400)
ggplot(cuse, aes(age, obs_u)) + geom_point(color="green") + 
  geom_point(mapping=aes(age, obs_s), color="red") +
  geom_function(fun=fit_u, xlim=c(17.5, 47.5), color="green") + 
  geom_function(fun=fit_s, xlim=c(17.5, 47.5),  color="red") + xlim(c(15,50)) +
  annotate(geom="text", x=49, y=fit_u(48), label="use")  +
  annotate(geom="text", x=49, y=fit_s(48), label="ster") +
  ggtitle("Contraceptive Use by Age", subtitle="Sequential Logits")
dev.off()
```

![](fig62r.png){.img-responsive .center-block .r}

We see that the two quadratics fit reasonably well, except for
overestimating the probability of sterilization among contraceptive
users at ages 15 to 19, a problem similar to that noted in the
multinomial logit model. We could easily remedy this deficiency by
adding a dummy variable for teenagers in the second-stage model.

*Exercise*. In the next section we will study ordered logit models. You
may want to try fitting an ordered logit model to this dataset treating
the three choices as ordered in terms of contraceptive effectiveness.
