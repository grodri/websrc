## 3.4 The Comparison of Several Groups

We now consider the comparison of more than two groups. We will illustrate
using the data on contraceptive use by age, where we compare four groups.

.include style

### A k-by-two Table

These are the data on page 18 of the notes, entered as four age groups

```{r}
library(dplyr)
cuse <- data.frame(matrix(c(
1,  72, 325,
2, 105, 299,
3, 237, 375,
4,  93, 101), 4, 3, byrow=TRUE))
names(cuse) <- c("ageg", "users", "nonusers")
cuse <- mutate(cuse, n = users + nonusers,
	ageg = factor(ageg, labels=c("< 25","25-29","30-39","40-49")),
	Y = cbind(users, nonusers))
cuse
```

### The One-Factor Model

Here is the model treating age as a factor with four levels, which is of
course saturated for the data.

```{r}
mageg = glm(Y ~ ageg, family=binomial, data=cuse)
summary(mageg)
```

Compare the parameter estimates with those on Table 3.5 of the notes.
Can you obtain these estimates by hand directly from the raw
frequencies? We see that the odds of using contraception increase
steadily from one age group to the next.

To test the significance of the age effects we can use a likelihood ratio test
comparing this model with the null, or a Wald test. Let us start with the former.
The `summary()` function reports the residual deviances for the null and
current models, so the reduction in deviance is easily seen, but I will 
calculate it explicitly for clarity.

```{r}
deviance(glm(Y ~ 1, family=binomial, data=cuse)) # minus 0
```

The value of 79.19 on 3 d.f. means that we can reject the hypothesis that
the probability of using contraception is the same in the four age groups.

Now for the Wald test, which is easily
calculated from first principles using the coefficients and their variance matrix.
Here's the test for the age effect on page 20 of the notes:

```{r}
b <- coef(mageg)[-1]
V <- vcov(mageg)[-1,-1]
t(b) %*% solve(V) %*% b 
```

Once again the likelihood ratio and Wald test are similar, but not identical.

Finally, we will compute the fitted logits, which we will need later.
We can do this using
the `predict()` function, which makes predictions in the logit scale.

```{r}
cuse <- mutate(cuse, obslogit = predict(mageg)) # or qlogis(users/n)
```

### A One-variate Model

We will now treat age as a covariate, using the mid-points of the four
age groups; so we treat the group 15-24 as 20, 25-29 as 27.5, 30-39 as
35 and 40-49 as 45. (If these don't look like mid-points to you, note
that age is usually reported in completed years, so 15-24 means between
15.0 and 25.0, and the mid-point is 20.0.)
The easiest way to code the midpoints in this example is
by using the age group numeric codes as indices into a vector of midpoints.

```{r}
cuse <- mutate(cuse, agem = c(20, 27.5, 35, 45)[as.numeric(ageg)])
```

We can now fit the model on page 20 of the notes, which has a linear
effect of age:

```{r}
magem <- glm(Y ~ agem, family=binomial, data=cuse)
summary(magem)
exp(coef(magem)["agem"])
```

We see that older women are more likely to use contraception, and that
the *odds* of using contraception are about six percent higher for every
year of age. (This comes from exponentiating the coefficient of age,
which is now measured in years.)

We can formaly test the assumption of linearity using a likelihood
ratio test to compare this model with the saturated model of the
previous section. The test can be calculated using
the `anova()` function, or calling `logLik()` directly.

```{r}
-2*(logLik(magem)-logLik(mageg))
```

The chi-squared statistic of 2.4 on one d.f. is not significant, indicating
that  we have no evidence against the assumption of linearity, and can happily
save two degrees of freedom. This statistic is, of course, the deviance
for the model with a linear effect of age.

We can also calculate the deviance "by hand" from first principles, using the
"sum of observed times log(observed/expected)" formula . Just remember
that you need to use observed and expected *counts* of both successes
and failures, here users and non-users:

```{r}
mutate(cuse, pusers = fitted(magem)*n) |> 
  summarize(dev = 2*sum(users*log(users/pusers) + 
    (n-users)*log((n-users)/(n-pusers))))
```

### Observed and Fitted Logits

The next step will be to compute fitted logits based on this model, and
use them together with the observed logits calculated earlier to examine
visually the adequacy of the linear specification, effectively
reproducing Figure 3.2 in the notes. For added measure I will also
consider a model with a quadratic term, centering age around 30 before
squaring it, so the linear term reflects the slope at 30.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
cuse <- mutate(cuse, agemcsq = (agem - mean(agem))^2)
magesq <- glm(Y ~ agem + agemcsq, family=binomial, data=cuse)
b <- coef(magesq)
f1 <- function(x) coef(magem)[1] + coef(magem)[2]*x
f2 <- function(x) b[1] + b[2]*x + b[3]*(x-mean(cuse$agem))^2
png("fig32r.png", width=500, height=400)
ggplot(cuse, aes(agem, obslogit)) + geom_point() +
  geom_function(fun=f1, color="blue") + 
  geom_function(fun=f2, color="green") +
  ggtitle("Figure 3.2: Observed and Fitted Logits By Age")
dev.off()
```

![](fig32r.png){.img-responsive .center-block .r}

The graph shows that the linear specification was adequate. There is a
hint that a quadratic model might be better, particularly in terms of
the fit for the oldest age group, but the quadratic term is not
significant.

You may wonder why I used functions to graph the fitted lines. Plotting
the fitted values joined by line segments works fine for the linear model,
but doesn't reflect well the curvilinearity of the quadratic model,
which is better represented using a function based on the coefficients.

This analysis gives us a quick indication of whether we could treat age
linearly if we were working with individual data and had the actual ages
of the 1607 women. It is not equivalent, however, because we have
grouped age, and therefore treated all women men aged 25-29 as if they
were age 27.5. With individual data some would be 25, some 26, etc.

You may also wonder why we were able to do a likelihood ratio test, when
a model treating age linearly is usually not nested in a model that
treats it as a factor. The answer is that in this case both
specifications are applied to grouped data. You can view the linear
model as imposing constraints, where the differences betwen the age
groups are proportional to the difference in years between their
midpoints. Alternatively, you can view the model that treats age as four
groups as equivalent to having linear, quadratic, and cubic terms
on the midpoints. Go ahead, try it. I'll wait.
