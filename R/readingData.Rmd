# 3 Reading and Examining Data

R can handle several types of data, including numbers, character strings, 
vectors and matrices, as well as more complex data structures. In this section 
I describe **data frames**, the preferred way to organize data for statistical 
analysis, explain how to read data from an external file into a data frame, and 
show how to examine the data using simple descriptive statistics and 
informative plots.

## 3.1 Lists and Data Frames

An important data structure that we have not discussed so far is the **list**. 
A list is a set of objects that are usually named and can be anything: numbers, 
character strings, matrices or even lists.

Unlike a vector, whose elements must all be of the same type (all numeric, or 
all character), the elements of a list may have different types. Here's a list 
with two components created using the function `list()`:

```{r}
person = list(name="Jane", age=24)
```

Typing the name of the list prints all elements. 

```{r}
person
```

You can extract a component of a list using the extract operator `$`. For 
example we can list just the `name` or `age` of this person:

```{r}
person$name
person$age
```

Individual elements of a list can also be accessed using their indices or their 
names as subscripts. For example we can get the name using `person[1]` or 
`person["name"]`. (You can use single or double square brackets depending on 
whether you want a list with the name, which is what we did, or just the name, 
which would require double brackets as in `person[[1]]` or `person[["name"]]`. 
The distinction is not important at this point.)

A **data frame** is essentially a rectangular array containing the values of 
one or more variables for a set of units. The frame also contains the names of 
the variables, the names of the observations, and information about the nature 
of the variables, including whether they are numerical or categorical.

Internally, a data frame is a special kind of list, where each element is a 
vector of observations on a variable. Data frames look like matrices, but can 
have columns of different types. This makes them ideally suited for 
representing datasets, where some variables can be numeric and others can be 
categorical.

Data frames (like matrices) can also accommodate missing values, which are 
coded using the special symbol `NA`. Most statistical procedures, however, omit 
all missing values.

Data frames can be created from vectors, matrices or lists using the function 
data.frame, but more often than not one will read data from an external file, 
as shown in the next two sections.

## 3.2 Free-Format Input

Free-format data are text files containing numbers or character strings 
separated by spaces. Optionally the file may have a header containing variable 
names. Here's an excerpt of a data file containing information on three 
variables for 20 countries in Latin America:
  
```
setting  effort   change
Bolivia            46       0        1
Brazil             74       0       10
Chile              89      16       29
  ... lines omitted ...
Venezuela          91       7       11
```


This small dataset includes an index of social setting, an index of family 
planning effort, and the percent decline in the crude birth rate between 1965 
and 1975. The data are available on this website in a file called `effort.dat` 
that includes a header with the variable names.

R can read the data directly from the web:
  
```{r}
fpe = read.table("https://grodri.github.io/datasets/effort.dat")
```

The function used to read data frames is `read.table()`. The argument is a 
character string giving the name of the file containing the data, but here we 
have given it a fully qualified url (uniform resource locator), and that's all 
it takes.

Alternatively, you could download the data and save them in a local file, or 
just cut and paste the data from the browser to an editor, and then save them. 
Make sure the file ends up in R's working directory, which you can find out by 
typing `getwd()`. If that is not the case, you can use a fully qualified path 
name or change R's working directory by calling `setwd()` with a string 
argument. Remember to double up your backward slashes (or use forward slashes 
instead) when specifying paths in Windows.

Here we assigned the data to an object called `fpe`. R's "official"" assignment 
operator is `<-` but I prefer `=`. Yo print the object simply type its name

```{r}
fpe
```

In this example R detected correctly that the first line in our file was a 
header with the variable names. It also inferred correctly that the first 
column had the observation names. (Well, it did so with a little help; I made 
sure the row names did not have embedded spaces, hence `CostaRica`. 
Alternatively, I could have used `"Costa Rica"` in quotes as a row name.)

You can always tell R explicitly whether or not you have a header by specifying 
the optional argument `header=TRUE` or `header=FALSE` to the `read.table()` 
function. This is important if you have a header but lack row names, because 
R's guess is based on the fact that the header line has one fewer entry than 
the next row, as it did in our example.

If your file does not have a header line, R will use the default variable names 
`V1`, `V2`, ..., etc. To override this default use `read.table()`'s optional 
argument `col.names` to assign variable names. This argument takes a vector of 
names. So, if our file did *not* have a header we could have used the command

```{.r}
> fpe = read.table("noheader.dat", col.names=c("setting","effort","change"))
```

Don't worry if this command doesn't fit in a line. R code can be continued 
automatically in a new line simply by making it obvious that we are not done, 
for example ending the line with a comma, or having an unclosed left 
parenthesis. R responds by prompting for more with the continuation symbol `+` 
instead of the usual prompt `>`.

If your file does not have observation names, R will simply number the 
observations from 1 to n. You can specify row names using `read.table()'s 
optional argument `row.names`, which works just like `col.names`; type 
`?data.frame` for more information. (I should mention that in a "tidy" world 
row names should just be another column, but classic R treats them as 
observation indices.)

There are two closely related functions that can be used to get or set variable 
*and* observation names at a later time. These are called `names()`, for the 
variable or column names, and `row.names()` for the observation or row names. 
Thus, if our file did not have a header we could have read the data and then 
changed the default variable names using the `names()` function:

```{.r}
> fpe = read.table("noheader.dat")
> names(fpe) = c("setting","effort","change")
```

*Technical Note*: If you have a background in other programming languages, you 
may be surprised to see a function call on the left hand side of an assignment. 
These are special 'replacement' functions in R. They extract an element of an 
object and then replace its value.

In our example all three-variables were numeric. R will handle string variables 
with no problem. If one of our variables was sex, coded `M` for males and `F` 
for females, R would have created a *factor*, which is basically a categorical 
variable that takes one of a finite set of values called *levels*. In Section 5 
we will use a data frame with categorical variables to illustrate logistic 
regression. Another way to generate factors is by grouping a numeric covariate. 
An example appears in Section 4 below.

*Exercise*: Use a text editor to create a small file with the following three 
lines:

```
a b c
1 2 3
4 5 6
```

Read this file into R so the variable names are `a`, `b` and `c`. Now delete 
the first row in the file, save it, and read it again into R so the variable 
names are still `a`, `b` and `c`.

## 3.3 Fixed-Format Input

Suppose the family planning effort data had been stored in a file containing 
only the actual data (no country names or variable names) in a fixed format, 
with social setting in character positions (often called columns) 1-2, family 
planning effort in positions 3-4 and fertility change in positions 5-6. This is 
a fairly common way to organize large datasets.

The following call will read the data into a data frame and name the variables:

```{.r}
> fpe = read.table("fixedformat.dat",  col.names = c("setting", "effort", 
"change"), sep=c(1, 3, 5))
```

Here I assume that the file in question is called `fixedformat.dat`. I assign 
column names just as before, using the `col.names` parameter. The novelty lies 
in the next argument, called `sep`, which is used to indicate how the variables 
are separated. The default is white space, which is appropriate when the 
variables are separated by one or more blanks or tabs. If the data are 
separated by commas, a common format with spreadsheets, you can specify `sep = 
","`. Here I created a vector with the numbers 1, 3 and 5 to specify the 
character position (or column) where each variable starts. Type `?read.table` 
for more details.

## 3.4 Printing Data and Summaries

You can refer to any variable in the `fpe` data frame using the extract 
operator `$`. For example to look at the values of the fertility change 
variable, type

```{r}
fpe$change
```

and R will list a vector with the values of change for the 20 countries. You 
can also define `fpe` as your default dataset by "attaching" it to your session:

```{.r}
> attach(fpe)
```

If you now type the name `effort` by itself, R will now look for it in the 
`fpe` data frame. If you are done with a data frame, you can detach it using 
`detach(fpe)`.  While `attach()` can save typing, experience has shown that it 
can also lead to problems, suggesting it is best avoided. For example, if you 
already have an object named `effort`, that will mask the object in `fpe`.  My 
advice is to always specify the data frame name, as we do below.

To obtain simple descriptive statistics on these variables try the `summary()` 
function:

```{r}
summary(fpe)
```

As you can see, we get the min and max, 1st and 3rd quartiles, median and mean. 
For categorical variables you get a table of counts. Alternatively, you may ask 
for a summary of a specific variable. Or use the functions `mean()` and `var()` 
for the mean and variance of a variable, or `cor()` for the correlation between 
two variables, as shown below:

```{r}
mean(fpe$effort)
cor(fpe$effort, fpe$change)
```

Elements of data frames can be addressed using the subscript notation 
introduced in Section 2.3 for vectors and matrices. For example to list the 
countries that had a family planning effort score of zero we can use

```{r}
fpe[fpe$effort == 0, ]
```

This works because the expression `fpe$effort == 0` selects the rows 
(countries) where the effort score is zero, while leaving the column subscript 
blank selects all columns (variables). 

The fact that the rows are named allows yet another way to select elements: by 
name. Here's how to print the data for Chile:

```{r}
fpe["Chile", ]
```

*Exercise*: Can you list the countries where social setting is high (say above 
80) but effort is low (say below 10)? Hint: recall the element-by-element 
logical operator `&`.

## 3.5 Plotting Data

<img src="boxplot.png" style="float:right; padding:0 0 2rem 2rem"/>

```{=latex}
\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.35\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth,keepaspectratio]{boxplot.png}
\end{wrapfigure}
```

Probably the best way to examine the data is by using graphs. Here's a boxplot 
of setting. Inspired by a demo included in the R distribution, I used custom 
colors for the box ("lavender", specified using a name R recognizes) and the 
title (`#3366CC`).

As noted earlier, R can save a plot as a png or jpeg file, so that it can be 
included directly on a web page. Other formats available are postscript for 
printing and windows metafile for embedding in other applications. Note also 
that you can cut and paste a graph to insert it in another document.

```{r include=FALSE}
png("boxplot.png", width=350, height=400)
par (mar=c(3,3,2,1), mgp=c(2,.7,0), tck=-.01)
boxplot(fpe$setting, col = "lavender")
title("Boxplot of Setting", col.main="#3366CC")
dev.off()
```

```{.r}
> boxplot(fpe$setting, col="lavender")
> title("Boxplot of Setting", col.main="#3366CC")
```

Here's a scatterplot of change by effort, so you can see what a correlation of 
0.80 looks like:

```{.r}
> plot(fpe$effort, fpe$change, pch=21, bg="gold")
> title("Scatterplot of Change by Effort", col.main="#3366CC")
```

```{r include=FALSE}
png("scatterplot.png", width=600)
plot(fpe$effort, fpe$change, pch=21, bg="gold")
title("Scatterplot of Change by Effort", col.main="#3366CC")
dev.off()
```

<img src="scatterplot.png" style="width:600px; margin:auto"/>
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth,keepaspectratio]{scatterplot.png}}

I used two optional arguments that work well together: `pch=21` selects a 
special plotting symbol, in this case a circle, that can be colored and filled; 
and `bf="gold" selects the fill color for the symbol. I left the perimeter 
black, but you can change this color with the `col` argument.

To identify points in a scatterplot use the `identify()` function. Try the 
following on the graph window:

```{.r}
> identify(fpe$effort, fpe$change, row.names(fpe), ps = 9)
```

The first three parameters to this function are the x and y coordinates of the 
points and the character strings to be used in labeling them. The `ps` optional 
argument specifies the size of the text in points; here I picked 9-point labels.

Now click within a quarter of an inch of the points you want to identify.
R Studio will note that "locator is active". When you are done clicking press 
the `Esc` key. The labels will then appear next to the points you clicked on. 
(If you are using the R GUI, the labels will appear as you click on the 
points.) 

Which country had the most effort but only moderate change? Which one had the 
most change?

Another interesting plot to try is `pairs()`, which draws a scatterplot matrix. 
In our example try


```{.r}
pairs(fpe)
title("Scatterplots for Setting, Effort and Change", col.main="#3366cc")
```

```{r include = FALSE}
png("pairs.png", width = 750)
par (mar=c(3,3,2,1), mgp=c(2,.7,0), tck=-.01)
pairs(fpe)
title("Scatterplots for Setting, Effort and Change", col.main="#3366cc")
dev.off()
```

<img src="pairs.png" style="margin:auto"/>
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{pairs.png}}

The result is a 3 by 3 matrix of scatterplots, with the variable names down the 
diagonal and plots of each variable against every other one.

Before you quit this session consider saving the `fpe` data frame. To do this 
use the `save()` function

```{r}
save(fpe, file="fpe.Rdata")
load("fpe.Rdata")
```

The first argument specifies the object to be saved, and the `file` argument 
provides the name of a file, which will be in the working directory unless a 
full path is given. (Remember to double-up your backslashes in Windows, or use 
forward slashes instead.)

By default R saves objects using a compact binary format which is portable 
across all R platforms. There is an optional argument `ascii` that can be set 
to `TRUE` to save the object as ASCII text. This option was handy to transfer R 
objects across platforms, but is no longer needed.

You can also save an image of your entire workspace, including all objects you 
have defined, and then load everything again, using

```{.r}
> save.image(file = "workspace.Rdata")
> load("workspace.Rdata")
```

In R Studio you can also do this using the Environment tab on the top right; 
click on the floppy disk image to save the workspace, or on the folder with an 
arrow to load a workspace. (In the R Gui you can use the main menu; choose 
`File|Save` and `File|Load`.)

When you quit R using `q()` you will be prompted to save the workspace, unless 
you skip this safeguard by typing `q("no")`.

*Exercise*:  Use R to create a scatterplot of change by setting, cut and paste 
the graph into a document in your favorite word processor, and try resizing and 
printing it. I recommend that you use the windows metafile format for the cut 
and paste operation.
