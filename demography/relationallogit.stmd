## Relational Logit Models

We illustrate fitting Brass's relational logit model using data from
the Seychelles.

### Seychelles Males, 1971-75

Here's a small dataset with the observed survival function for
Seychelles males in 1971-75. We also include Brass's standard for
convenience. (Alternatively, the Brass standard is available in five and
single-year forms in Stata files in the datasets section, so you can
merge on age; the files are called `Brassrlm1.dta` and `Brassrlm5.dta`.)

.include srtabs

```s
	infile age lx ls using ///
	  https://grodri.github.io/datasets/seychelles.dat, clear
```

```r
	sc <- read.table("https://grodri.github.io/datasets/seychelles.dat",
	  header = FALSE, col.names = c("age","lx","ls"))
```

We generate Brass logits and plot the logits of the observed and
standard survival functions to see if the relationship is linear.

```s
	gen yx = 0.5*log( (1-lx)/lx)
	gen ys = 0.5*log( (1-ls)/ls)
	twoway (scatter yx ys) (lfit yx ys), name(a, replace) ///
	  ytitle(observed) xtitle(standard) title(Logit) legend(off)
```

```r
	library(dplyr)
	library(ggplot2)
	sc <- mutate(sc, yx = 0.5*log( (1-lx)/lx), ys = 0.5*log( (1-ls)/ls))
	lf <- lm(yx ~ ys, data=sc)
	sc$yfit <- fitted(lf)
	g1 <- ggplot(sc, aes(x = ys, y = yx)) + geom_point() + 
	  geom_line(aes(x = ys, y = yfit)) + ggtitle("Logit") 
```

The fit is not bad at all. Here are the parameter estimates, and the
fitted survival, which we plot on a second panel:

```s
	reg yx ys
	predict yf
	gen lf = 1/(1+exp(2*yf))
	twoway (scatter lx age) (line lf age), name(b, replace) ///
	  ytitle(lx) title(Survival) legend(off)
	graph combine a b, title(Brass's Relational Logit Model) ///
	  subtitle("Seychelles, Males, 1971-75") xsize(6) ysize(3)
	graph export seym71rlm.png, replace
```

![](seym71rlm.png){.img-responsive .img-center .stata}

```r
	library(gridExtra)
	sc <- mutate(sc, lfit = 1/(1 + exp(2 * yfit )))
	g2 <- ggplot(sc, aes(x = age, y = lx)) + geom_point() + 
	  geom_line(aes(x = age, y = lfit)) + ggtitle("Survival")
	g <- arrangeGrob(g1, g2, ncol=2)
	ggsave("seym71rlmr.png", plot=g, width=10, height=5, dpi=72)
```

The parameter estimates could be used, for example, to
generate a single-year life table

```s
	drop _all
	use https://grodri.github.io/datasets/brassrlm1
	predict yf
	gen lf = 1/(1+exp(2*yf))
	list age lf in 1/5
```

```r
	library(haven)  
	rlm1 <- read_dta("https://grodri.github.io/datasets/brassrlm1.dta")
	yfit1 <- predict(lf, newdata=rlm1)
	cbind(1:5, 1/(1 + exp(2 * yfit1[1:5])))  
```

The relational logit model doesn't always fit well. Typically, lack of
fit is noticed at the young and old ages. Zaba(1979) proposed a
4-parameter extension that incorporates two patterns of deviations from
the standard and improves the R-squared to 0.9997. Ewbank, De Leon and
Stoto (1983) proposed an alternative extension that uses different power
transformations at young and old ages, converging to the logit as the
powers approach 0. They also proposed a small revision of the standard
below age 15. Both extensions are non-linear in the additional
parameters and thus hard to fit, although the authors provide ingenious
approximate estimation procedures. More recently Murray et al (2003)
proposed a modified system that starts from the logit transformation
but adds two sets of age-specific coefficients which adjust for under-five 
and adult survivorship.

regional series of Coale, Demeny and Vaughan (1983) and the
log-quadratic system of Wilmoth et al.â€‰(2012), see
