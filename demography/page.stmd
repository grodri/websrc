## The Page Model of Marital Fertility

We apply Page's model of marital fertility by age and duration to study
urban-rural differentials in Colombia, following essentially the
procedures in Rodr√≠guez and Cleland (1980).

We will work with an extract from the 1976 WFS that has the dates of
R's birth, first union and interview, the birth history, and type of
place of residence.

.include srtabs

```s
	use https://grodri.github.io/datasets/cofertx, clear
```

```r
	library(haven)
	co <- read_dta("https://grodri.github.io/datasets/cofertx.dta")
```

### Events and Exposure

We will focus on fertility in the three-years before the interview. A
woman starts contributing events and exposure 36 months before the
interview or when she enters a first union, whichever occurs later. We
create the variables `bot` and `top` to mark the start and end of
exposure.

```s
	gen bot = v007 - 36
	replace bot = m012 if m012 > bot
	gen top = v007 - 1 
	drop if bot >= top // no in-union exposure
```

```r
	library(dplyr)
	co <- mutate(co,
	  bot = ifelse(m012 > v007 - 36, m012, v007 - 36),
	  top = v007 - 1) |> 
	filter(bot < top)
```

The next step is to count births in the window, occurring between `bot`
and `top` (the month before the interview). The WFS coded the dates of
birth of up to 24 children in variables called
`b012 b022 b032 ... b242`. We loop by variable and use 
[a local macro zj ]{.stata}[`paste()` ]{.r}to construct the
names with zero-padded birth numbers.

```s
	gen births = 0
	forvalues j = 1/24 {
	  local zj = "`j'"
	  if `j' < 10 local zj = "0`j'"
	  quietly replace births = births + 1 if b`zj'2 >= bot & b`zj'2 <= top
	}
```

```r
	co$births <- 0
	for(j in 1:24) {      
	  name = paste(ifelse(j < 10, "b0","b"), j, "2", sep="")
	  co$births <- co$births + (co[,name] >= co$bot & co[,name] <= co$top)
	}
```

Each woman is exposed for exactly 36 months unless she married in the
last three years, in which case we take the difference between the dates
of marriage and interview. (One could count only half a month of
exposure for the calendar month of marriage, but I will ignore this
refinement, partly because we do count all births in that calendar month
anyway.) We also need the midpoint of the window, so we can compute age
and duration since first union at that time.

```s
	gen expo = (top - bot + 1)/12
	gen mid = (bot + top)/2
	gen age = (mid - v008)/12
	gen dur = (mid - m012)/12
```

```r
	co <- mutate(co,
	  expo = (top - bot + 1)/12,
	  mid = (bot + top)/2,
	  age = (mid - v008)/12,
	  dur = (mid - m012)/12)
```

### Regression Analysis

Next we use our handy function to compute natural fertility, and
calculate an offset equal to the log of natural fertility times exposure
time

```s
	egen nf = natfer(age)
	gen os = log(nf * expo)
```

```r
	library(nuptfer)
	co <- mutate(co,
	  nf = natfer(age),
	  os = log(nf * expo))
```

All that remains is to fit the model using two terms to represent the
effects of urban residence: a dummy variable for the spacing effect and
an interaction with duration for the limiting effect [(which I create to
get a simpler name). ]{.stata}

```s
	gen urban = v702 == 1
	gen urbanXdur = urban * dur
	poisson births dur urban urbanXdur, offset(os)
```

```r
	co <- mutate(co, urban = as.numeric(v702 == 1)) # 1=urban
	m <- glm(births ~ dur * urban + offset(os), 
	  data = co, family = poisson)
	coef(summary(m))
```

The results show a spacing parameter of 0.008 and a limiting parameter
of -0.025 for rural areas. Urban areas have essentially the same level
of natural fertility (the difference of -0.097 is not significant), but
significantly higher levels of limiting behavior (the difference of
-0.467 is highly significant).

### Translation into Rates

We can translate these results into rates that may be easier to present.
First we compute the mean age at first union of our sample, and notice
that urban women married about 10 months later than rural women.

```s
	gen afu = (m012 - v008)/12
	tabstat afu, stat(mean) by (urban)
```

```r
	co <- mutate(co, afu = (m012 - v008)/12)
	group_by(co, urban) |> summarize( mean = mean(afu))
```

We then predict fertility at the mid-point of each year since union,
from 0.5 to 19.5, for women entering their first union at these average
ages, and sum the rates for the first 20 years in union:

```s
	gen d = _n - 0.5 in 1/20
	egen nfr = natfer(19.06 + d) in 1/20
	egen nfu = natfer(19.89 + d) in 1/20
	gen fr = nfr * exp(_b[_cons] + _b[dur]*d)
	gen fu = nfu * exp(_b[_cons] + _b[urban] + (_b[dur] + _b[urbanXdur]) *d)
	gen Fu = sum(fu) in 1/20
	gen Fr = sum(fr) in 1/20
	list d Fu Fr in 20
```

```r
	d <- 1:20 - 0.5
	nf <- c(natfer(19.06 + d), natfer(19.89 + d))
	nd <- data.frame(
	  urban = rep(c(0,1), c(20,20)),
	  dur = d,
	  os = log(nf))
	nd <- mutate(nd, 
	  fer = exp(predict(m, newdata = nd)))
	group_by(nd, urban) |> summarize( tmfr = sum(fer) ) 
```

The urban and rural total marital fertility rates are 4.17 and 6.70, a
difference of two and a half children 20 years after the first union.

Finally we plot duration specific rates at mean ages of entry into
union:

```s
	line fr fu d, lpat(solid dash) ///
	  xtitle(Years since first union) ///
	  title("Fertility by Duration Since First Union") ///
	  subtitle("Colombia WFS, 1976") ///
	  legend(order(1 "Rural" 2 "Urban") ring(0) pos(7))
	graph export comarfer.png, width(500) replace
```

![](comarfer.png){.img-responsive .img-center .stata}


```r
	library(ggplot2)
	nd <- mutate(nd, area = factor(urban, labels = c("rural","urban")))
	ggplot(nd, aes(dur, fer, color=area)) + geom_line() +
	  ggtitle("Marital Fertility by Union Duration, Colombia WFS, 1976")
	ggsave("comarferr.png", width = 500/72, height = 400/72, dpi = 72)
```

![](comarferr.png){.img-responsive .img-center .r} 

We see how fertility declines more steeply with duration of union in urban areas.
