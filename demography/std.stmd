## Rates and Standardization

We will work through the example in Preston et al., sections 2.2 and 2.3.

### Sample Data

I copied the counts of mid-year population and deaths by Age for Sweden and 
Kazakhstan from Table 2.1 into a text file that is available in the datasets
section. 
The file is in "long" format. As usual, I show the analysis in R and Stata.

.include srtabs

```s
	infile str10 country str5 ageg pop deaths ///
	  using https://grodri.github.io/datasets/preston21long.dat, clear
	list in 1/3
```

```r
	p21 <- read.table("https://grodri.github.io/datasets/preston21long.dat",
	  header=FALSE, col.names = c("country", "ageg", "pop", "deaths"))
	head(p21, 3)
```

The first thing to do is to calculate the age-specific rates, dividing deaths by 
population and multiplying by 1000:

```s
	gen rates = 1000 * deaths / pop
```

```r
	library(dplyr)
	p21 <- mutate(p21, rates = 1000 * deaths / pop)
```

Crude death rates are just a weighted average of age-specific rates using the 
population in each age group as the weight. We can easily compute them like this:	

```s
	tabstat rates [fw=pop], by(country)
```

```r
	group_by(p21, country) |>
	  summarize(crude = weighted.mean(rates, pop))
```

The interesting result here is that mortality appears to be *lower* 
in Kazakhstan than in Sweden.

### Standardized Rates

Following Preston et al., we will standardize the rates using the average of 
the two population compositions as the standard. To do this we calculate first 
the percent distribution in each country and then average the percents. 
While we are at it we will also calculate the average rates.

```s
	egen pcpop = pc(pop), by(country)
	egen avgcomp = mean(pcpop), by(ageg)
```

```r
	p21 <- group_by(p21, country) |>
	  mutate(pct = pop/sum(pop))
	avg <- group_by(p21, ageg) |>
	  summarize(pop = mean(pct), rates = mean(rates))
```

Now we can easily compute the standardized rates using the average composition 
as the standard. [Because we assigned the grouped data to p21 we can skip the 
grouping step.]{.r}

```s
	tabstat rates [aw=avgcomp], by(country)
```

```r
	summarize(p21, std = weighted.mean(rates, avg$pop))
```

We see that once we adjust for age composition the mortality rate is in fact 
*higher* in Kzakhstan than in Sweden, actually 61.1% higher.

### Indirect Standarization

Frequently we don't have age-specific rates, but can easily obtain the age 
distribution. We can still do a form of standardization by applying the rates 
of one country (or any other standard) to the two age distributions. Let us 
use the rates for Sweden and apply them to both countries. To do this we sort 
by age and country, and for each age pick the second value

```s
	bysort age (country): gen swrates = rates[2]
	tabstat swrates [fw=pop], by(country)
```

```r
	sweden <- filter(p21, country == "Sweden")
	summarize(p21, istd = weighted.mean(sweden$rates, pop))
```

So if Kazakhstan had Swedish rates the CDR would be 4.2. 
The ratio of the actual CDR to the expected rate under the standard age 
structure is known as the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) and turns out to be	

```s
	quietly sum rates [fw=pop] if country == "Kazakhstan"
	scalar kzcmr = r(mean)
	quietly sum swrates [fw=pop] if country == "Kazakhstan"
	di "SMR = ", kzcmr/r(mean)
```

```r
	filter(p21, country == "Kazakhstan") |>
	  summarize(istd = weighted.mean(sweden$rates,pop), 
	  crude = weighted.mean(rates,pop), smr = crude/istd)
```

Mortality in Kazakhstan is in fact 77% higher than it would be at Swedish rates 
with the observed age composition.

The indirect standardized rate for Kazakhstan is defined as the product of the 
SMR by the crude death rate for Sweden, 7.767 Ã— 10.548 or 18.639.

*Note*: Stata has commands `dstdize` and `istdize` for direct and indirect
standardization. The Stata Forum has an [entry](https://bit.ly/36pKweW) 
showing how to use those commands to reproduce the calculations on this page.

### Decomposition of Differences between Rates

Preston et al. show how to decompose a difference between two rates into a part 
due to compositional differences and a part due to differences in rates. 
The two components are obtained by  applying the average composition to the 
observed rates, and by applying the observed compositions to the average rates.
An important property f this decomposition is that it is exact.

```s
	egen avgrates = mean(rates), by(ageg)
	tabstat avgrates [fw=pop], by(country)
```

```r
	dbr <- summarize(p21,
	  crude = weighted.mean(rates,pop),
	  comp = weighted.mean(rates, avg$pop), 
	  rates = weighted.mean(avg$rates, pop)); dbr
```

We see that with the same rates the older composition of Sweden would result in 
much higher mortality than observed. We can now verify the decomposition:

```s
	display "Difference = " 10.55 - 7.42 ///
	  "; Composition = " 13.44 - 5.81 ///
	  "; Rates = " 7.37 - 11.88    
```

```r
	c(-1, 1) %*% as.matrix(data.frame(dbr[,-1]))
```

So the observed difference of 3.13 points in the CBR between Sweden and Kazakhstan 
results from a compositional effect of +7.63 and a difference in rates of -4.51.

I wrote a Stata program that can do these calculations for data in "wide" format. 
In net-aware Stata type `net from https://grodri.github.io/demography` and 
check out the `ddrate` command.

### Age-Patterns of Mortality

So far we have focused on attempts to summarize mortality in a single number, 
but why not look at the complete set of rates? I would like to plot the rates 
using the mid-points of the ages groups (with 87.5 for 85+). To compute these 
I first convert age from a string to numbers (1 to 19) and then figure out the 
midpoint of each group.

```s
	encode ageg, gen(agei)    // "05-9" becomes 3
	gen agem = 5*agei - 7.5   // 3 becomes 7.5
	replace agem = 0.5 if ageg == "0"
	replace agem = 3   if ageg == "01-4"
```

```r
	p21 <- mutate(p21, 
	  agei = as.numeric(as.factor(ageg)), 
	  age = ifelse(agei > 2, 5*agei - 7.5, ifelse(agei == 1, 0, 3)))
```

We then plot the rates using a log scale (otherwise we wouldn't see much)

```s
	twoway (line rate agem if country=="Sweden")   ///
       (line rate agem if country=="Kazakhstan")   ///
      , yscale(log) ylabel(50 100)                 ///
      title("Age-Specific Mortality Rates")        ///
      xtitle("Age") ytitle("log(ASMR)")            ///
      legend(order(2 "Kazakhstan" 1 "Sweden") ring(0) pos(5) cols(1))
	graph export swkzasmr.png, replace width(500) height(400)
```

![](swkzasmr.png){.img-responsive .img-center .stata}

```r
	library(ggplot2)
	ggplot(p21, aes(x=age, y=log(rates), color=country)) + geom_line()
	ggsave("swkzasmrr.png", width=500/72, height=400/72, dpi=72) 
```

![](swkzasmrr.png){.img-responsive .img-center .r}

We see clearly that mortality is higher in Kazakhstan than in Sweden at every 
age. The lines are not exactly parallel, in fact the relative difference seems 
to become smaller at older ages. (We will discuss later how heterogeneity can 
produce this type of convergence.)

### The Modern Regression Approach

The aim of standardization is to control for a compositional variable. This, of 
course, is also one of the aims of regression analysis. I now show how one could 
analyze the data using Poisson regression, a method appropriate for count data.

This regression technique assumes that the number of deaths has mean (and 
variance) given by the product of a rate and exposure time. The log of the mean 
is then the log of the rate (which is modeled using a linear predictor, just as 
in linear regression) times the log of exposure (which is defined as an offset, 
or a fixed part of the linear predictor). That's why the code below computes 
the log of the mid-year population counts. We also represent country using a 
dummy variable for Kazakhstan.

```s
	gen logexpo = log(pop)
	gen kz  = country == "Kazakhstan"
	poisson deaths i.agei kz, offset(logexpo) nolog
	di exp(_b[kz])
```

```r
	p21 <- mutate(p21, logexpo = log(pop), kz = as.numeric(country=="Kazakhstan"))
	fit <- glm(deaths ~ ageg + kz + offset(log(pop)), data = p21, family = poisson)
	coef(summary(fit))
	exp(coef(fit)["kz"])
```

Exponentiating the coefficient of Kazakhstan, we see that on average age-specific 
mortality is 61.5% higher than in Sweden, a result very similar to the 61.2% that 
we obtained using direct standardization.

An advantage of the regression approach is that one can easily control for 
multiple confounders. Also, we can test for the presence of an interaction, 
which would question the validity of the additive model underlying direct 
standardization. In this case, adding the interaction would make the model 
saturated for this data, so we just test goodness of fit.

```s
	estat gof 
```

```r
	data.frame(deviance = deviance(fit), df = fit$df.residual)
```

The deviance of 2218 on 18 df is highly significant, so we conclude that the 
rates are not proportional. With data based on national counts, however, even 
small differences can be statistically significant. This interaction represents 
less than one percent of the combined effect of age and country.

```s
	di r(chi2_d)/e(chi2)
```

```r
	deviance(fit)/(fit$null.deviance - deviance(fit))
```

If the discussion in the last section doesn't make much sense to you, don't 
worry. Just make a note to come back and read it again after taking a course 
on generalized linear models.
