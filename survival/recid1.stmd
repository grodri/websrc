## Weibull and Log-Normal Models

The dataset considered here is analyzed in Wooldridge (2002) and
credited to Chung, Schmidt and Witte (1991). The data pertain to a
random sample of convicts released from prison between July 1, 1977 and
June 30, 1978. Of interest is the time until they return to prison. The
information was collected retrospectively by looking at records in April
1984, so the maximum possible length of observation is 81 months.

Wooldridge fits Weibull and log-normal models using the following
predictors:

  Variable   Description
  ---------- -------------------------------------------------
  workprg    an indicator of participation in a work program
  priors     the number of previous convictions
  tserved    the time served rounded to months
  felon      and indicator of felony sentences
  alcohol    an indicator of alcohol problems
  drugs      an indicator of drug use history
  black      an indicator for African Americans
  married    an indicator if married when incarcerated
  educ       the number of years of schooling, and
  age        in months

We will reproduce his results using R and Stata. The data are available
in binary format from the Stata website and consists of 1445
observations on 18 variables. The duration variable is called `durat`
and represents time in months until return to prison or end of follow
up. The censoring indicator is called `cens` and is coded 1 if the
observation was censored (i.e.Â the individual had *not* returned to
prison).

.include srtabs

We create a new variable `fail` coded 1 for failures.

```s
    use https://www.stata.com/data/jwooldridge/eacsap/recid, clear
    desc, short
    gen fail = 1 - cens
```

```r
    library(haven)
    library(dplyr)
    recid <- read_dta("https://www.stata.com/data/jwooldridge/eacsap/recid.dta")
    recid <- mutate(recid, fail = 1 - cens)
    head(recid)
```

### A Proportional Hazards Weibull Model

Let us first fit a proportional hazards model with a Weibull baseline,
[using `stset` to set the data and `survreg` to fit the model. To avoid
repetition we will save the predictors in a macro.]{.stata} [which we
can do using `survreg` with `dist` set to "weibull". For convenience we
save the model formula so we can reuse it later.]{.r}

```s
    stset durat, failure(fail)
    local predictors workprg priors tserved felon alcohol drugs ///
        black married educ age
    streg `predictors', distrib(weibull) nolog
```

::: stata
By default Stata exponentiates the coefficients to show relative risks.
Use the option `nohr` for *no* hazard ratios to obtain the coefficients.
:::

```s
     streg, nohr
```

```r
    library(survival)
    mf <- Surv(durat, fail) ~  workprg + priors + tserved + felon +
        alcohol + drugs + black + married + educ + age
    wf <- survreg(mf, data=recid, dist="weibull")
```

::: r
By default R reports coefficients in the accelerated failure time
metric. I wrote a simple function to convert them to a proportional
hazards metric, which you can download from this website as shown below.
I also work with *p = 1/scale*.
:::

```r
    source("https://data.princeton.edu/pop509/aft2ph.txt")
    phfit <- aft2ph(wf); phfit
```

This reproduces Table 22.1 in Wooldridge. <!-- 20.1 in first edition -->
All but three of the predictors have significant coefficients, the exceptions 
being participation in a work program, marital status, and education.

::: r
To obtain *hazard ratios* we exponentiate the coefficients. We also
report the Weibull parameter *p*, while R uses scale = 1/p.
:::

```r
    transmute(phfit, term, hazard.ratio = exp(estimate))
    exp(tail(phfit,1)$estimate)
```

The Weibull parameter *p* is 0.8, indicating that the risk of recidivism
declines over time, about 21% per month. The hypothesis that the risk is
constant over time would be soundly rejected.

The exponentiated coefficient of drugs indicates that former inmates
with a history of drug use have 32.5% higher risk or returning to jail
at any given time than peers with identical characteristics but no
history of drug use.

### Accelerated Failure Time Weibull

We can also work with the Weibull model in an accelerated failure time
framework, [which we can do by simply adding the `time` option:]{.stata}
[which is in fact the default in R. We'll use the `summary()` function.
(An alternative is to use `tidy` to produce a data frame.]{.r}

```s
    streg `predictors', distrib(weibull) time nolog
```

```r
    summary(wf)
```

The substantive results are the same as before, which is not surprising
given that it is really the same model. You may want to verity that the
AFT parameters are exactly the same as the PH parameters with opposite
sign and divided by *p*. For example the coefficient for drugs is
-0.28/0.8 = -0.35.

The coefficients may be exponentiated, which allows interpreting them in
terms of *time ratios*. [You can do this in Stata using the `tr` option.
We will focus on one coefficient.]{.stata}

```r
    exp(coef(wf))
```

Exponentiating the drug coefficient that see that former inmates with a
history of drug use spend 29% less time out of prison than peers with
the same observed characteristics by no history of drug use. This is
easier to see substracting one from the exponentiated coefficient

```s
    di exp(_b[drugs]) - 1
```

```r
    exp(coef(wf)["drugs"]) - 1
```

We can also say that time outside of prison passes 42% faster for former
inmates with a history of drug use than for those without, everything
else being equal, which you can verify by changing signs and
exponentiating:

```s
    di exp(-_b[drugs]) - 1
```

```r
    exp(-coef(wf)["drugs"]) - 1
```

The two interpretations are, of course, equivalent.

### A Log-Normal AFT Model

The Weibull model allows the hazard to increase or decrease with time,
but at a constant rate. Wooldridge notes that the log-normal
distribution provides a better fit to the data. We can fit a log-normal
model with the same tools, just by changing the distribution to
"lognormal".

```s
    streg `predictors', distrib(lognormal) nolog
```

::: stata
We do not need to specify `time`, as this distribution is only available
in the AFT metric.
:::

```r
    lnf <- survreg(mf, data=recid, dist="lognormal")  
    summary(lnf)
```

We see that the log-likelihood is indeed higher for the log-normal
model, [-1597.1 compared to -1633.0]{.stata}[-3156.1 compared to
-3192.1]{.r} for the Weibull, so we now have a better fit to the data.

You may be interested to know that Stata and R report different
log-likelihoods. For example the log-normal log-likelihood is -1597.1 in
Stata and -3156.1 in R. This is because R works with the distribution of
*time* and Stata with the distribution of *log(time)*. The difference
turns out to be the Jacobian of the transformation, which is the sum of
*log(t)* over all failures, or 1559.1. Differences between
log-likelihood are not affected by this constant term.

Most of the effects are robust to the choice of distribution, but note
that the protective effect of marriage is now significant. The
coefficient for drugs, at -0.30, is smaller in magnituded and less
significant than before.

### Other Parametric Models

Fitting a generalized gamma model leads to similar conclusions, except
that the effect of drugs is no longer significant. This result suggest
that there may be an interaction between drug history and duration, as
the effect depends on how the hazard is specified. We will return to
this issue later.

The generalized gama model is [available in Stata as part of
`streg`.]{.stata} [*not* available in R's `survival` package, but you
will find it in the package `flexsurv`, which also allows fitting
Gompertz models.]{.r}
