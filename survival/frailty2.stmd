## Interpretation of Frailty Models

We continue our discussion of shared frailty models with a focus on interpretation 
of the results  using various calculations based on the parameter estimates.

### The Distribution of Frailty

The estimated variance of frailty at the family level is 0.2142. In terms of 
Clayton's model this means  that the hazard given that a sibling died at age 
*a* is 21.4% higher than the hazard given that the sibling survived age to *a*.

Using the result of Oakes, we can also say that the Tau correlation between 
sibling survival times is estimated to be 0.097, so the probability of a 
concordant pair is about 10 percentage points higher than the probability of a 
discordant pair. (The "pair" here refers to a pair of mothers, say A and B, each 
with two children, say 1 and 2. The pair is concordant if both children of mother 
A die at younger (or older) ages than the children of mother B. The pair is 
discordant if child 1 of A lives longer than child 1 of B but child 2 of A dies 
younger than child 2 of B. The interpretation is not terribly useful in this 
application because most observations are censored and thus one can't establish 
concordance or discordance.)

A more direct approach is to look at the actual distribution of frailty. 
[Stata has a function `gammaden(a, b, g, x)` to compute the density of the 
gamma distribution with shape `a`, scale `b` (which is *1/ÃŸ* in our notation) 
and location `g` (here 0).]{.stata} 
<code>b = 1/a</code></span>.
[R has a function `dgamma(x, shape, rate = 1, scale = 1/rate)` to compute 
the density of the gamma distribution with given shape and scale (or its 
reciprocal the rate).]{.r}
To obtain a distribution with mean 1 and variance `v` we set the shape
parameter to `1/v` and the scale to `v`.


```s
	scalar v = exp( -1.5407144 )
	twoway function y=gammaden(1/v,v,0,x), range(0 3) ///
		title("Gamma density with mean 1 and variance 0.214")
	graph export gfr.png, width(500) replace 
```

![](gfr.png){.stata}

```r
	v <- exp( -1.5407144 )
	theta <- seq(0, 3, 0.02) 
	density <- dgamma(theta, shape = 1/v, scale = v)
	gd <- data.frame(theta, density)
	library(ggplot2)
	ggplot(gd, aes(theta, density)) + geom_line() + 
		ggtitle("Gamma Density (mean 1, var 0.214)")
	ggsave("gfrr.png", width = 500/72, height = 400/72, dpi = 72)
```

![](gfrr.png){.r}

We can also compute quantiles. 
[Stata has a function `invgammap(a, p)` to compute quantiles of the standard 
gamma distribution with shape `a`, which has scale 1 and location 0. 
A gamma with shape `a` and scale `b` is just `b` times a standard gamma with 
shape `a`.]{.stata}
[In R we use `qgamma(q, shape, rate = 1, scale = 1/rate, lower.tail = TRUE)`
to compute quantiles.]{.r}
So here are the quartiles of the distribution depicted above.

```s
	mata v = st_numscalar("v")
	mata q = invgammap(1/v, (0.25,.50,.75) )*v
	mata q
	mata q :/ q[2] :- 1
```

```r
	p <- (1:3)/4
	q <- qgamma(p, shape = 1/v, scale = v); q
	q / q[2] - 1
```

So the quartiles are 0.66, 0.93 and 1.26. Computing the ratios Q1/Q2 and Q3/Q2,
we see that families with  frailty at Q1 have 29% lower risk, and families with 
frailty at Q3 have 36% higher risk, than families with median frailty. Clearly, 
unobserved family characteristics have a very substantial effect on child survival.

### Distribution of Observed Risks

It may be interesting to contrast the above results with the risks that can be 
attributed to observed characteristics.

At this point we need the results from the piecewise exponential model with gamma 
frailty. I saved the file generated in the previous log as `pebleystupp2.dta`. 
We read the file [and fit the model again.]{.stata} </span>
[and then read the parameter estimates from `pebleystupp2.dat`.]{.r}

```s
	use https://grodri.github.io/datasets/pebleystupp2, clear 
	streg i.dur mage mage2 borde pdead p0014 p1523 p2435 p36up i011a1223 i011a24p i1223a24p , ///
		dist(exponential) frailty(gamma) shared(momid) nolog
```

```r
	library(haven)
	gux <- read_dta("https://grodri.github.io/datasets/pebleystupp2.dta")
	gux$death <- unlist(gux[,"_d"])
	b <- scan("https://grodri.github.io/datasets/pebleystupp2.dat")
```

Next we simply predict the hazard holding family frailty constant at one. 
Remember, however, that each child contributes one or more pseudo observations,
but should be counted once only, so we pick first segments.

```s
	predict haz, haz
	sum haz if _t0==0, detail
	di r(p25), r(p50), r(p75)
	di  r(p25)/r(p50) - 1, r(p75)/r(p50) - 1
```

```r
	mf <-  death ~ factor(dur) + mage + mage2 + borde + pdead + 
		p0014 + p1523 + p2435 + p36up + i011a1223 + i011a24p + i1223a24p
	X <- model.matrix(mf, data = gux)
	haz <- exp(X %*% b)
	first <- gux$dur == 0
	r <- quantile(haz[first], probs = 1:3/4); r
    r/r[2] - 1
```    

So children who are at Q1 of the observed risk factors, have 12% lower risk, 
and children at Q3 of observed risk factors have 17% higher risk, than children 
at the median of observed risk factors. Looks like characteristics that are 
observed at birth have a smaller impact on survival than unobserved family 
characteristics. (We have not considered time-varying covariates, such as the 
birth of another child, but one can calculate their impact for any given child 
by specifying a trajectory.)

### Subject-Specific Probabilities

Another approach to presenting results is to calculate survival probabilities. 
I will calculate probabilities of surviving to ages one and five, the complements 
of the infant and child mortality "rates". First let us get the baseline hazard, 
the width of the intervals, and thus the cumulative baseline hazard. 
(The current run includes a constant, so we need to take that into account.)

```s
	mata:
		b = st_matrix("e(b)")
		h = exp(b[17] :+ b[1..5])
		w = (1, 5, 6, 12, 36)
		H = runningsum(w :* h)
	end
```

```r
	h <- exp(b[1] + c(0, b[2:5]))
	w <- c(1, 5, 6, 12, 36)
	H <- cumsum(w * h)
```

Next I will focus on a mother who is 26 years old (pretty close to the mean age), 
is having a second child  (so we can include the length of the first interval 
as a predictor), and has not experienced a child death before giving birth to 
the second child. We consider first the case where the preceding birth interval 
is 3 years or longer.

The relevant parameters for age, age-squared, birth order and previous birth 
interval are in positions 6, 7, 8, and 13 of the vector of parameters.

```s
	mata xb = b[6]*26 + b[7]*26^2 + b[8]*2 + b[13]
```

```r
	xb <- b[6]*26 + b[7]*26^2 + b[8]*2 + b[13]
```

We can now compute the survival function for the average family with these 
characteristics. We will also change the previous birth interval to one year, 
by removing the coefficient in position 13 and adding the one in position 10:

```s
	mata 1 :- exp( -H * exp(xb) )
    mata 1 :- exp( -H * exp(xb - b[13] + b[10]) )
```

```r
	1 - exp( -H * exp(xb) )
	1 - exp( -H * exp(xb - b[13] + b[10]) )
```

So the probabilities of infant and child death for the average 26-year old mother 
having a second child are 5.7 and 8.6% with a three-year interval, 
and 14.1% and 20.7% with a one-year interval.

If we consider instead mothers at the first and third quartiles of frailty we obtain

```s
	mata:
		1 :- exp( -H * q[1] * exp(xb) ) 
		1 :- exp( -H * q[1] * exp(xb - b[13] + b[10]) ) 
		1 :- exp( -H * q[3] * exp(xb) ) 
		1 :- exp( -H * q[3] * exp(xb - b[13] + b[10]) ) 
	end
```	

```r
	1 - exp( -H * q[1] * exp(xb) ) 
    1 - exp( -H * q[1] * exp(xb - b[13] + b[10] ) ) 
    1 - exp( -H * q[3] * exp(xb) ) 
    1 - exp( -H * q[3] * exp(xb - b[13] + b[10] ) ) 
```

So for a low-risk (Q1) family, the probability of child death goes from 
5.8 to 14.2 when we compare long and short intervals. 
For a high-risk (Q3) family, the corresponding probability goes from 
10.8 to 25.4%.

### Population-Average Probabilities

We can also calculate the average probabilities in the population of 26-year old 
mothers having a second birth.  
From the results in the notes, the (complements of) the survival probabilities 
under gamma frailty are

```s
	mata  1 :- (1 :/ (1 :+ v * H :* exp(xb))) :^(1/v)
    mata  1 :- (1 :/ (1 :+ v * H :* exp(xb - b[13] + b[10]))) :^(1/v)
```

```
	1 - (1 / (1 + v * H * exp(xb)))^(1/v)
	1 - (1 / (1 + v * H * exp(xb - b[13] + b[10])))^(1/v)
```

So on average, the probabilities of infant and child deaths are 5.7 and 8.6% 
with three-year intervals and  13.9 and 20.3% with one-year birth intervals. 
These are a bit lower than the corresponding probabilities for the average 
family with the given characteristics. (The difference is modest because by 
ages one and five there hasn't been a lot of time for selection to operate.)

### Marginal, Joint and Conditional Probabilities

One last calculation we can do explicitly under gamma heterogeneity involves 
the marginal and joint probabilities of infant and child death for two children 
in the same family.

We could do these calculations for 26 year-old mothers having a second birth 
three or more years after the first, but unless they have twins the calculation 
of bivariate probabilities doesn't make a lot of sense. So I will do the 
calculations for a second birth at age 26 and a third at age 29, everything else 
being the same. (A simpler approach would be to do the calculations for mothers 
whose observed risk factors put them at the median.)

Applying the results in the notes:

```s
	mata xb2 = b[6]*29 + b[7]*29^2 + b[8]*3 + b[13]
	mata S1 = (1 :/ (1 :+ v * H :* exp(xb))) :^(1/v)
	mata S2 = (1 :/ (1 :+ v * H :* exp(xb2))) :^(1/v)
	mata S12 = (1 :/ (1 :+ v * H :* (exp(xb) + exp(xb2)))) :^(1/v)
	mata S1 :* S2 \ S12
```

```r
	xb2 <- b[6]*29 + b[7]*29^2 + b[8]*3 + b[13]
	S1  <- (1 / (1 + v * H * exp(xb)))^(1/v)
	S2  <- (1 / (1 + v * H * exp(xb2)))^(1/v)
	S12 <- (1 / (1 + v * H * (exp(xb) + exp(xb2))))^(1/v)
	matrix( c(S1 * S2 , S12), 2, 5, byrow=TRUE)
```

So the probability of two children surviving to age five is slightly higher than 
the product  of the two marginals.  A better way to see the correlation is to 
calculate a two by two table with survival to age five for two children in the 
same family.

```s
	mata M = ( 1 - S1[5] - S2[5] + S12[5] , S2[5] - S12[5] \ S1[5] - S12[5], S12[5])
	mata M    
	mata (M[1,1]/M[1,2]) / (M[2,1]/M[2,2])
```

```r
	M <- matrix( c(1 - S1[5] - S2[5] + S12[5] , S2[5] - S12[5], S1[5] - S12[5], S12[5]), 2, 2)
	M
	(M[1,1]/M[1,2]) / (M[2,1]/M[2,2])
```

The last calculation is an odds ratio: the odds of one child dying by age five 
are 23.9% higher if the other child  died by age five than if the other didn't!

A [separate note](frailty2r) discusses the use of log-normal frailty, 
which has the important advantage that it extends easily to multi-level models. 
Calculation of unconditional survival, however, requires numerical integration.
The results are very similar to those presented here.
